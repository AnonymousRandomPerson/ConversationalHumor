Can we make this quick?
You're asking me out.
Why?

You have my word.  As a gentleman

Hi.

Well, no...

I'm kidding.
Wow

They do to!
Did you change your hair?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Great
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
It's more
Neat...
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Where've you been?
You are so completely unbalanced.
I don't get you.
He said everyone was doing it.
But
That's not
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Let go!
Patrick -- is that- a.
Now don't get upset.
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Wear the belly before you go.
I'm missing something.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
You the new guy?
So -- which Dakota you from?
That I'm used to.
That girl -- I --
You know French?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
What about him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
You got him involved?
This is it.
Number one.  She hates smokers
He's pretty!
Assail your ears for one night.
You told me that part already.
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
You humiliated the woman!
What've you got for me?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
What 're you talking about?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
What'd you do to her?
You makin' any headway?
What's the worst?
The vintage look is over, Kat.
Hey -- do you mind?
Where ya goin?
Leave my sister alone.
Yeah
Two legs, nice rack...
You got it, Verona.
Take it or leave it.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I just upped my price
It's about time.
How'd you do it?
I don't know, Dorsey.
Hey.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
You better not fuck this up.
Who's that?
Mandella, eat.
What's this?
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
You think this'll work?
What'd he say?
You went to the party?
Can you even imagine?
Have you seen him?
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Pick you up Friday, then
You hate me don't you?
Are you following me?
You're not a big talker, are you?
hey.  Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
What's this?
Okay?
You're not okay.
This is so patronizing.
Why'd you let him get to you?
Kat! Wake up!
And I'm in control of it.
I should do this.
Start a band?
Oh, so now you think you know me?
So what ' s up with your dad?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?
Wholesome.
He left!
Put your right foot there --
The Partridge Family?
A soft side? Who knew?
You up for it?
State trooper?
Tell me something true.
Is that a request or a command?
Create a little drama?
My grandmother's .
That ' s completely adorable!
Wait I...
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Besides, I had some extra cash.
I know.
My insurance does not cover PMS
Was that your sister?
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.
Katarina Stratford.
Tempestuous?
Am I supposed to feel better?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
You think?
Macbeth, right?
Say it
What plan?
That's where we can help you.
What?!
Ever been to Club Skunk?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
I missed you.
I don't understand, Patrick.
You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Jesus!
What do you wanna watch?
Have a great time, honey!
What just happened?
I never seen heat like this!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
He's the devil's child...
We should have seen land.
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Trade, Your Excellency.
He is a mercenary!
You can see for yourself.
I could be gone for years.
She said yes.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
God... you're so beautiful!
They took everything...
Can't you stay with us a little?
What is it, now?  Tell me...
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
My letters of appointment.
How far from here?
I want to go with you!
I have to explore the mainland.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Father...
What are you listening to?
What does he say?
No...
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.
You defend yourself admirably...
But we do have a lack of notaries.
All I have to do is call the guards.
I am not afraid of you.
What do you see?
Say not here!  Cuba!
You come!  You speak first!
Chief says -- how many?
To bring the word of God.
We will work with his people.
You have to find them, Utapan.
Utapan, won't you speak to me?
God... That's in a week!
Why do you wish to sail west?
How can you be so certain?
You mustn't give way to despair.
Colon!
All of them!  Just lies!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
I am listening, my son.
May God forgive you...!
I believed in you...
I suppose we're both old men now.
I have to disagree.
The ocean is uncrossable?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
May I speak freely?
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Do they have such thoughts?
But without your brothers.
And you say this is an Indian vice?
We lost cousins, friends.
You want a war?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
Due west, Captain Mendez.
Well.
What do you read?
What's he doing?
Where can I meet this man?
You lied!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
... Into a monk...
... But there is worse.
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Are you my attorney?
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Don't say anything.
I brought you some letters.
...delusions and paranoia.
Tell me about yourself.
That's what he did to me.
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
Now I become custody of police department?
Are you married?
I can't take you to my place.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
I came here.
I'm not a whore.
Are you alright?
Is he your boyfriend?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.
You better get packed.
Do you have coffee?
What are you doing?
Forget about me.
I told your partner, I can't help.
Are you here illegally?
A cop?
Oh.
Who did cause and origin?
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training.
Chief - mind if I take her?
Don't you guys understand?
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
It was freaky, I'll tell you.
I'm gonna propose.
What's he looking for?
Where is she?
Sorry...PD only.
Only one guys checked in?
The other side of the street.
Are you hit?
He got my gun!
Who's there?
What's wrong?
Yeah.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
He said he was her cousin.
You know what that is, right?
It's your crime scene now.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
What would you call her?
I'll come with you.
You goin' to the escort service?
I'll let you know what happens.
Two heads.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison.
You thirsty?
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Why not?
She's fucked.
Look - let me talk to her.
Yeah, just her in the shower.
So...who's Nicky?
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Eddie, are you okay?
Hey, honey.
What is your problem?
Look at this.
Don't worry about the damn phone.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.
Okay, til tonight.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
How old are your kids?
So what's unique?
He's from Antigua.
I hope this prick doesn't run.
Ready?
Any chance we can do that again?
Okay.
Are you married?
Come to 45 Broadway.
Were you a fireman?
You can't kill me.
C'mon.
Where's your partner?
Tell him to put his gun down!
Hi, I'm Honey.
Listen to me.
Give me the address!!
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
We are both from Prague.
Who is he?
This all you want?
Just do what I do.
Don't fool around.
Did you hear what I said?
Look.
Look.
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
What?
Turn that fucking thing off!
Speak English!
Whore?
Get in the bathroom!
Gotta light the scene better.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
What is it?
What is that?
Let me get a shot of it.
No.
Okay.
You are success story?
I'm serious.
This is my project.
You got that?
Traitor!!
Emil???!
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!
We spent it!
I can get you a job.
Robert...?
Viewer discretion advised!
Isn't he a little moody?
Yeah?
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
I know.
Yes...he's my friend.
I speak English.
No.  Go ahead.
What was that?
I'll take him.
Got any spare change?
Okay, you're under arrest!
I'll send a cop back for you.
You okay?
What's that on your forehead, Max?
Where you been, man?
Nah, not at all.
Mouth's clean, too.
What?
-- From Czechoslovakia?
You go home.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!

How's the detective business?
I love you.
This is the mortgage.
Hello?
Amy, just listen.
What happened to you?
Why haven't you called?
You owe me an explanation.
You should have.
Who are you calling?
She died in her sleep three days ago.
What are these?
Anything harder?
What do you want?
What the fuck... !
It's an honor to meet you.
I'd like to commission a work.
You said something about money.
That's five thousand dollars.
I'll do this for you.
Where's that?
You brought the money?
Excellent.
What are these for?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Friend of yours?
I'll get it.
Is that him?
You're a dead man.
... sorry...
You got the guts, tough guy?
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.
Celebrity Films.
What's he talking about?
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't ask questions.
Starting to recognize a pattern?
Okay, we'll come back to that.
I don't know.
Keep moving.
You can't go to the cops.
Do it.
You know how my tapes sell.
Yes, I do have something to say.
You were the middleman, am I right?
You're making me very angry.
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
Give me the film.
He's lying.
Big date tonight?
Truman Capote.
Remember me?
I need some information.
How long you been working there?
... Hello... ?
How old are you?
Wha... ?
Who is he?
You don't need to be here.
What's next?
What's this?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Uh huh, pleasure.
Have a pleasant evening.
He's odd.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.
Pittsburgh?
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
I didn't know what to think.
Please, believe me.
You... you need to go to the police.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
Okay...
Hello... ?
Hello?
Yes... ?
What was the name... ?
So, she didn't leave a note?
People remember me from the news.
Doesn't make much sense, does it?
I've got what I need for my report.
You were right.
I think about it everyday.
Hello... ?
What are you talking about... ?
Mrs.
Yes... I remember Mary
Do you know what happened to her?
What is this?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
Okay, I'll take it all.
Alright.
Yeah.
Rick...I can't.
Alice, you think you can leave?
You alright?
I heard you screaming.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?
I can't go back to sleep again.
We'll figure it out.
Here you are.
My mom taught me when I was little.
I daydream.
You what?
Kristen, what happened?
You in a hurry?
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
You've been up all night?
No...
I thought it was an accident.
I was there in the dream.
No, don't!
I've been working double shifts.
How long have you been awake?
Not really.
You don't really get it.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
He's going after Debbie.
Here we are.
What the hell was that?
You look great!
Rick, please.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Hey, Rick!
I don't get it.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
Hey man, we're all sorry...
Been up with Alice.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
What's wrong with me?
I'm sorry honey, but...
Something wrong with the stairs?
What is it?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I'll tell you later.
Feeling better now?
I gotta get out of here.
Excuse us, dear.
Hey...wake up.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Hi, you don't look very well.
Is that who you're waiting for?
No you're not.
Who says I don't like you?
Mommy...?
Where is he?
What do you mean?
But how...?
Hi, beautiful.
The tickets.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
About him?
You stopped it didn't you?
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Dad!
Where are we going?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
I'm so sorry, honey...
How was the meeting?
Alice!
Good to see you again, Mr.
It was no accident.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?
Did everyone call everyone?
What's that got to do with it?
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
I don't understand what's happening.
You had me scared on the phone.
Oh, Alice.
Look.
Are you alright?
You think that's the place she's buried?
What?
But how are we gonna --
You do good work, Alice.
He sure loves to stay awake.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
I've got to write some of this down.
Mark, are you okay?
I thought about that.
Then get out!
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Who's Jacob?
Whoa, slow down.
Where are you going?
I couldn't do that, Mark.
They think I'm nuts.
No, it's our problem, Mark.
They couldn't prove it.
Poor woman...
I don't understand.
Meet me later.
That club sucks, they card everybody.
He's right.
Oh man!
These things are wild...  What do you think?
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Look.
Bottom line, Alice.
Dan.
Vomit?
It's okay.
You, too?
You could train someone else.
What is it?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Unidentified Flying Objects.
That's enough, Holloway.
Reef!
You've asked why I stay a bachelor?
Cyclops?
We're stuck tight!
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
You all wait here.
How about that!
Yeah?
I don't hear anything.
Hey - you know somethin'?
You hear that?
Well?
Here - keep these.
Dave - !
Get ready.
Is there any way out of it?
Course and speed?
What course, Skipper?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
Excuse me, Skipper---
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
We read you!
Now they feel it...down below.
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
As we near the Pole...
All ready?
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
'Doctor' Neilsen?
What do you think?
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
What's the running time?
Right <u>at</u> him?
A hundred and eighty fathoms!
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Remove your weapons, Commander.
Swell!
He did!
Why not me?
It is a living thing.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
See what?
Well, I'll be - !
You plotted the course of Cyclops?
Due north.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Are you alright, Wade?
This is from three years ago.
What are you boys up to?
I screwed up the divorce.
You heard the news.
You see it?
He's on to us!
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
I'm okay.
I used to play ball.
Safety on?
Fresh tracks.
Don't mind if I do.
No brag. Just fact.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Like you and Gordon?
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
I'm fucking out of here.
Open the door, will ya?
I'm sorry for the screw-up.
Those are the Hoyts.
Why do they do that?
Go on, Jill.
Some party, huh?
She's gone already!
Sit right there by yourself if you want.
Dad.
Are we going in this?
How about a Big Mac?
Nothing, I guess.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
That's illegal, you know.
Jill, please, it's alright.
We're looking for the funniest costume!
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Told you the snow was coming down.
What's the hurry?
Fuck.
That must've been Twombley.
What the fuck.
How you holding up, Wade?
Sorry about the long lunch.
What do I have to do for it?
Wade, you're done.
Lillian!
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
Wait there.
No problem. Look, I...
Are you okay, Wade?
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
Don't worry.
You okay?
You don't mean that.
Call me.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess.
Money.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Are you sure they're home?
Strange.
This is nuts.
What happened?
What on earth is happening to you?
Going somewhere, Margie?
Have you been heating the house?
Coffee's perked.
It makes me sad.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Who are you?
Take care, Wade.
It don't look right.
Marg!
You talked to Jack?
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
Wade, I got a message for you.
Rolfe.
Just do it.
What was that?
Where's Ma?
Yeah.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You!
Love!
Where the Christ you going?
Rolfe.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
What about Margie?
I want to let the gas run out.
Find them everywhere. 
It's too neat.
I know what it means.
We'll talk at home.
He's in a meeting.
Mom?
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I don't drink coffee.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
He didn't leave us.
Oooooh, I'm good.
How was...  ...the ballet?
Alice!
Daddy...
How you doing, sweetie?
There they are!
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
It's cut.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Mr.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
How we doing, Colonel?
Uh, we got a problem here.
Aw, man.
He's dead then.
They aren't answering their hails.
They've got no chutes.
Sir, you threw out page two.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
Can we do that?
But they start executing hostages in
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA.
That's affirmative.
We've already been inspected.
The rest of the secret service?
Who did this?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
How?
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President?
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
Ms.
And all these rooms here?
Here's a press kit.
*                     Please tell me your name.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Fear will keep you alive.
Now, or he dies, please.
Leave my daughter alone.
Do you have to be so brutal?
But they are not ny people.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter?
Nor will there be.
Four...
You got what you wanted.
She isn't a part of this.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Stop.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
There goes your ride.
No you won't.
Madame Vice president.
Finally, we can bargain.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy.
We've already played our cards, Major.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
I'll not going without my family.
Sir, we stay with the President.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Don't.
You know what?
How did your speech go?
Look on the bright side, hon.
I don't know why you stayed.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
What are you doing?
The fax machines.
Where are we sending it?
Someone should give you a raise.
Did they say anything about my family?
and if that means negotiating...
Please, Mr.
What's going on?
One.
White House switchboard.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.
You wanna knock of f?
It's bait.  Don't take it.
I said it's not worth the fight.
You give me ulcers.
Shepherd.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
Shit.
Twenty five minutes.
IT'S OPEN!
WE'RE HOOKED!
What?
That's right, Commissioner.
Forget it.  I was reading.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Did you feel that?
Oveur.
Shut down accelerators.
Dunn.
Elaine.
It's got to be stopped!
Ted, what's wrong?
Ted, you're overworked.
Elaine.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.
His name's David Stockman.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Ted!  What are you...?
Ted, we're taking off!
What are you doing, Ted?
Ted.
Elaine.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.
Elaine!
Elaine, I'm going back there.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Simon just ejected!
Are you afraid?
We've blown the computer!
Ted, the lever!
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Elaine!
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Simon, what's happening?!
My career is shot.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.
Roger.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R".
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Come on up, Jimmy.
Take this, Joey.
That's how I want them.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
No, a bomb.
Captain Oveur?
That's how dry cleaning works.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
You folks need any help?
I have to see Bud Kruger.
You can't go in there!
Are you on the Mercury mission?
Striker.
Excuse me, are you alright?
You've been hurt.
Do you want to talk about it.
No.
Ah, won't you sit down?
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline.
Shep, sit...sit!
Both pilots!
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
George Zipp said that?
Captain, how soon can we land?
Can't you take a guess?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
Sir.
You'd better tell the Captain.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
What did he have?
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish.
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew.
No. No one that I know of.
Elaine!
It's the truth.
Ted, what are you doing here?
What's the matter?
Elaine, just hear me out.
You got a telegram from headquarters today.
Is it?
What's his problem?
I think they're getting the hang of it!
Ted!
Rain.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Rats! I've lost number three.
But Ted, you're the only...
Ted...
See them, Elaine?
We have a visitor.
We'd better get back now.
Hey, we've been waiting for you.
Airsick?
Good-bye, darling.
And get that finger out of your ear.
Eight miles.
He's all over the place!
He's right on the heading.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Oh, I can't stand it.
How ya doing, honey?
Wait a minute.
You <u>are</u> Kareem.
I'm an airline pilot.
Hi!
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Yes?
Sorry, Clarence.
Roger.
Roger.
We have clearance, Clarence.
No, he's not bothering anyone.
Excuse me, Sister?
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Oooh.
You okay?
You are Cassandra?
He's not here.  Why ask me?
In there.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
Look at your dildo partner.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson.
William Harcourt?
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
Kill them both.
... and we work my hours.
Man, somebody really hung one on you!
Let's talk Hubley.
Terrific.
What is wrong?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
What's this?  What's going on?
What is this?
Get the picture?
Rudyard Kipling?
Why did you do it?
Who said that?
Screw you.
Tell me.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
You know that guy?
Which one is that?  Raw what?
Who is he?
I believe he is probably lying.
Yeah... I know the routine.
Your home is quite disordered.
Human children can be very beautiful.
Your health...
I'm going home.
Where'd you get this?!!
She's going to divorce me.
Well, let's roll, George.
Stop the car.
It's all right, George.
What was that about?
... So we've got three guys dead.
What's this nothing shit?
No secrets, goddammit!
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.
Uh, George...
George, c'mon -- lighten up.
Shit!
What's this about, George?
No!  We must do this alone.
What is this?!
How do I look?
You think this is the guy who did it?
That where Anderson worked?
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.
Here's Hubley.
Released December one.
One of the two men was Hubley, right?
Yeah, right.
No I.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
What kind of test?
Yeah, Sykes?
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
How can I go?
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
You got your vest?
Watch the driver.
Get outta there!
This floor's freezing.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Movement!
...that's better.
Okay, let's do it.
First squad up, on line.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
And it's too late to shut it down?
I'll go.
It's going to be closer.
HOW MUCH TIME?
Ripley...
You did okay, Bishop.
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Have they located my daughter yet?
Is she...?
Amy.
No.  There's no way!
What about you?
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
Yes, and I've read it.
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
You never said anything about an android being here!
I hope you're right.  I really do.
That the atmosphere processor?
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
No good.
You son of a bitch.
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.
I expected more of you, Ripley.
Still nothing from the colony?
What's he scanning for?
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
One of us?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
What is it?
So.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
I told them to fall back...
How do you feel?
At ease.
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
All right, the area's secured.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Hah!
We're not making that out too well.
Save it.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Well that's great!
Outstanding.
We got problems.
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
The corner!  Ready?
Seventeen meters.
Well you're not reading it right!
Let's go!  Let's go!
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.
All right.
They're in the approach corridor.
Now many?
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
They'll get us.
What's this?
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
It's game time.
They learned.
Locked.
No!
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Ellen.
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
Oh, man.
It's inside the complex.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Looks like it stung him.
You can't help them.
Thanks.
We need the other drop-ship.
They cut the power.
Range twenty meters.
Fifteen meters.
Twelve meters.
Nine meters.  Eight.
And how are we today?
Bad dreams again?
What did you say?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
I don't want you for a friend.
They'd be here if they could, honey.
I was the best at the game.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Now you just lie here and have a nap.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
I don't know, Newt.
Don't go!  Please.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Burke!  Open the door!
Come on.  Crawl faster.
This way.
I knew you'd come.
Mommy...Mommy?
Are we going to sleep now?
Look, I told you...
Look, I can see where this is going.
Why won't you check out LV-426?
How many colonists?
Follow me, please.
Maestro.
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
What does he look like?
Did you know? Had you heard?
How was I? Tell me honestly.
Katherina!
Oh - excuse me!
Is she a good fuck?
No, no, no, no.
No! I won't have him back.
Why what, sir?
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
What is it?
Stop it!
No! No! No!
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Excuse me, Wolfi.
I think you're mad!
Stop it now.
My Stanzi - look at her!
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
There's a young girl to see you.
We'll have a little party.
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
You're not going to do this?
Who was that?
What's that?
No. Don't answer it!
This is my wife, Stanzi.
Give me one reason I can understand.
Go back to bed.
Excellency!
Frau Mozart?
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
These are originals?
It is miraculous.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor.
Come back tonight.
It's a post all Vienna seeks.
I do apologize for this afternoon.
What are you doing here?
This is not his handwriting.
How much will you pay him?
Am I interrupting something?
I see that you're expecting.
What is ridiculous?
And so you do!
Be careful!
He's adorable!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
Let us pass, please!
I am sorry, Madame, but no!
Upstairs.
I've heard about you for ages!
I said play!
What a strange young man.
Really?
Perhaps a little refreshment first?
Just one year.
What a charming idea. May I see?
Delightful, Court Composer.
A-flat, Majesty.
My pleasure.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Good morning, Court Composer.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Do you like this, Salieri?
Your Majesty!
Oh, thank you.
And now he has returned the compliment.
Majesty!
Why so?
Well, what is it about?
Yes, where?
Keep it, Sire, if you want to.
I don't understand.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber.
Really?
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Bravo, Mozart.
Mozart, I am a tolerant man.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic.
Forgive me, Majesty.
Ah-ha.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you have for me today?
I write to you with urgent news.
Why are you here?
Feed?
Do you always live like this?
She's very tired, poor creature.
What's that?
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Thank you.
No, really!
Yes, Papa, name it.
I'm tired of this game.
Papa, is this your idea?
Are you playing a trick on me?
Never mind.
Father -
Ah!
Ah-ha!
Thank you.
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Where does he work?
Now calm yourself.
Yes?
Sssh!
What did he say? What did he say?
Well?
Wonderful!
Isn't he marvelous?
I'm serious.
Leave that alone!
Quiet!
You won't be teaching this one either.
I'm afraid I am.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Never mind, Strudel.
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Herr Mozart.
I'm sorry. No.
I know your work well, Signore.
Love, Sire!
Yes!
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
Look, I must have pupils.
Wolfgang, what is it?
Nine performances!
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
I have come to commission work from you.
How long will you give me?
I don't have it yet.
What happened? Is it over?
Where is your wife?
I would never miss anything that you had written.
Shall I answer it?
Wait!
Another?
Where did I stop?
Confutatis Maledictis.
The Fire.
Start with the voices.
Good.
Now the orchestra.
It couldn't be simpler.
And that's all?
Do you have me?
That's wonderful!
C Major.
And that's it. Do you have it?
Do you want to rest a bit?
Oh? Have I seen it?
You mean in Turkey?
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Mozart!
What are you doing, Herr Director?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Herr Mozart -
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
Mozart -
What do you want?
I can't say I do.
Well?
Oh, I know that!
Do you hear me?
It was incomprehensible.
Yes, Father.
What?
Why?
You mean that play?
Are you absolutely sure?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
What anger?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Here I am, my angel.
Well, I don't know!
This is embarrassing, you know.
That lady is back, sir.
What does he want?
Herr Salieri.
Oh, by the way, give him this.
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Oh, Miss Price?
Did he say a wolf?
It's all right, Susan.
He's not?
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
Surely you're not suggesting...
He's here.
Could you get here without any trouble?
What shall we do?
It wasn't a lunatic.
Mr. Kessler?
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Call me David.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
You're a very beautiful girl.
What do you dream about?
How old are you?
Hello. You all right?
I'm a werewolf.
Are you better now?
My friend Jack was just here.
The kitchen.
Closet.
It's nice to see you.
Alex?
Tomorrow is the full moon.
I'm off.
David!
Alex, I've lost my mind.
The next corner we can get a cab.
But...
David, what are you doing?
I am going to the cops.
David, please be rational.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
Sir, he's very upset.
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Leave me alone, dammit!
Hello, Benjamin.
Feeling better?
How are we feeling tonight?
He all right?
Miss Price.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
All right, you two, move along.
Who is this girl?
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
Here, Gladys, Tom.
All right, laugh then.
Oh, all right.
No one brought them here!
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Hello, David.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
How long have I been here?
There were witnesses?
You've never had bad dreams before?
Dr. Hirsch?
Are you cold?
Jack.
Well, I like it here.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
The Slaughtered Lamb?
Hello.
Nice looking group.
What about it?
Ask them what the candles are for.
Go on, ask them.
Jack, we'd better go.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?
What the hell was that all about?
That was weird.
What do you think was wrong?
Say, David...
Did you hear that?
Could be a lot of things.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
Shit! David, what is that?
It's moving.
What's the plan?
It's in front of us.
Oh shit. What is that?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
See anything?
It sounds far away.
Jack?
You really scared me, you shithead.
Nice to see you.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
I'm going completely crazy.
It's you, David.
You're not real.
What are you doing here?
Hi, Jack.
What can I say, Jack?
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
Because this must be stopped.
I could hang myself.
Dr. Hirsch?
No, thank you, Doctor.
You were saying?
What can we do to assist you?
Yes?
Excuse me.  Yes?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
What's that?
Do you have any hot soup?
Hot chocolate?
Remember the Alamo?
No, thank you.
Sorry.
He may have a point, Lieutenant.
Hello, Tom.
What do you suppose anybody wants?
What's the idea of turning her down?
Oscar, what's the matter?
Whose death?
Where you been?
What's the matter, Charlie?
Mr. Dickson in yet?
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
How are you protecting your depositors?
You know Dickson as well as we do.
What's the matter with my policy?
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
Most of the creditors I know personally.
I'm running this bank my way.
We want to talk to you.
We'll be forced to shut the doors.
Say, you can't do that
That is simple, isn't it?
Thanks.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot.
Don't be a fool, Cluett.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
Confessed!
She wasn't to blame, Mr.
Then what did you want to gamble for?
Good heavens, man!
What do you mean?
This won't do.
What is the matter with you?
Here, here, here, now!
Doesn't that come next?
Oh!
What?
What's this?
Why, Matt!
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
The butler said I could stay.
I'm not interested in what you think.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Excuse me
Shall we let the people come in?
Good morning, Mr.
Well, look who's here!
What's the matter dear?
Ho! Ho! Ho!
All right.
Listen, dear.
Good morning.
Longer.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Come on in here, Helen.
Good morning, Helen.
Oh!
Yes?
Yes?
Helen!
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Mr. Dickson?
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
It's all right. Thanks.
What's the matter?
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr.
I already told him I was home.
Wait a minute.
No. I won't.
I want you both to take the day off.
What's the matter?
What time did this thing happen?
That's what he says.
You were right, Mr. Dickson!
My wife?
You're lying!
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Good.
The lobby's half filled now.
They've been coming in steady all morning.
Look at them, Mr.
The fools!
We can't keep open till four o'clock.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Quiet down, please!
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Oh, well.
Hello, Helen!
What did you do with it?
No.
What happened?
What's the matter, Matt?
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
In Cluett's office?
What's keeping you?
Shh .
Oh, Matt . . .
What's he doing, honey?
Did you talk to him?
Dickson's in a jam I tell you.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
What did you find out, Mike?
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
for the rheumatism, you know.
What time was it?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
Then who changed it?
So you were home last night?
But I wasn't here, Mr.
How are you fixed?
Everybody in?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
You can ride like that?
I couldn't lose him.
This is healing?
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
He's smiling.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Here's Liberty's favorite son!
Uhh, yeah it does.
No, Jimmy has a point.
We got a problem here, brother?
That's what the newspapers say.
This is the best score yet.
How'd they --
Bob. I didn't...
I'm sorry, Cole.
Things changed when you quit the gang.
Yesterday.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Damn!
Home.
How many of them did he kill?
You have no shame.
But if we take their money and supplies...
All right, settle down.
Beg pardon?
This is about the "Wanted!
What?
What you sayin' boy?
You shut up now, boy.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Ride with me, cousin?
Where you boys going?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
Not now.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She had a moustache.
Thanks for the help.
Because we were good at it?
This isn't a feud, this is war.
I'll pick the first job!
The James-Younger Gang.
I got seven thousand.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
It's not a bank.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
Beautiful.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Still smells fishy.
Fine. We hit this bank.
Dammit!
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
We'll make them pay for this.
Missed you, cousin.
Where'd you get all these riders?
Cannon or Gatling?
What the --
I think one of 'em's glass.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Hey!
Jesse.
Another dozen out back.
The safe. Now.
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
You 'um big lawman?
Of St. Louis?
Go ahead to the saloon.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
What the --
Where the hell were you?
Web died fighting?
Boys...
What do you say, sir?
You know you're welcome any time!
Daddy, don't start with this again.
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
They're gone. What are you --
He thinks this is some kind of game!
Distracting enough for you?
Web's dead.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
Frank, don't you have something to say?
All we thought about was coming home.
That just might work.
"Big and older"?
She's still talking to Jesus.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
You know him?
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
... We could move on.
How'd it go in there?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
I don't think it's counterfeit.
This has been a good year.
We're drunk.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
They're all pinned down.
Shoulda learned with Web.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
Allow a man his version of the past.
Uncle Frank?
Did you kill Yankees?
Easterners.
Ma! Please!
Riders --
Doc Mimms will --
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
But still died.
Jesse, are you awake?
Jesse, is that your hand?
You shouldn't be up.
Ahem.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Zee.
I don't understand.
Hmm.
I beg your pardon?
Don't turn around.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
Tennessee?
We're moving you tomorrow.
Did you order our houses burned down?
You almost ended my career before it began.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Almost got me in Billings.
Oh.
That was for my Ma.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee.
This is unusual.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.
Now let's have a drink.
And you're too young.
I like that.
You okay, Jesse?
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Well, not exactly.
What about that Rock Island bastard?
... too young for whisky...
Why, yeah.
Really?
Devereux.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Relax, Alan.
How can that be?
There's only four of them...
Your men knew the risks.
With my money!
The final route for the railroad is complete.
Parker.
That.
This is him.
How did you know?
Look at this, Pinkerton!
You wouldn't have done that?
It's early in the game yet, Mr.
Pinkerton.
First of all: you, shut up.
So he's won.
What the hell is that sound?
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
J&B. Straight.
Luis is a despicable twit.
No, you idiot.
It's a plain end. I think.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it.
See?
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
What are you doing tonight?
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
Patrick?
I haven't seen you around here.
You have a really nice place here.
I'm not so sure about this.
Nothing like last time, promise.
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Marzipan.
Why don t you just go for Price?
Are you using minoxidil?
I want a firm commitment.
Why? What's wrong?
We need to talk.
You're really serious, aren't you?
No, no, no.
Where are you going?
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody.
Because he dated her.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Listen, what about dinner?
Are you my two o'clock?
Can I help you?
Doesn't he live here?
I think you should go now.
Don't come back.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Jesus, Davis.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia?
Carnes? Wait.
Now, Carnes, listen to me.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney.
Patrick? Is that you?
Call me please, Patrick.
What...is...it?
Van Patten looks puffy.
That's Paul Owen.
Jeez.
SHUT UP!
Oh come on.
What's that, a gram?
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Yes, Caron's right.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Don't, I'll drink it.
Dorsia.
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Dorsia, yes?
We are totally booked.
Late?
Oh? And what should I say?
Okay, Jean.
Oh, something. . romantic?
Yes?
You don't like this, I take it?
What is it?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Patrick?
Yes, Patrick?
Jean?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Anywhere you want?
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Jean? Sorbet?
Want a bite?
Do you have a boyfriend?
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Yes.
Patrick Bateman's office.
...to the office this afternoon.
So, what do you do?
Welt...it depends, why?
Oh really?
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Well.
Hubert's?
She's my...cousin.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
This tastes weird.
Did you know that guy who disappeared?
Listen, John, I've got to go.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
So, what's the topic of discussion?
KIMBALL.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Bad habit.
Would you rather I not smoke?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
How well did you know him?
Yeah...Yale thing.
Don't you know this?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
Have you consulted a psychic?
You'll have to excuse me.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell?
How's the investigation going?
I mean they want to get caught.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Never.
No hash browns?
So, the night he disappeared?
He does? You're sure?
Oh, right.
I'm so hungry.
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
Why don't you get another one?
Hello, Halberstam.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
And Cecelia, how is she?
Paul, give me your Amex card.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Hey, Halberstam?
You think so?
How can he lie like that?
Is it over?
Alice?
I'm just screwed.
I can't help it.
I think I kind of lost it.
A lot of what Larry says is true.
It's important.
When I was a kid?
When's Brian coming for the TV?
That took some fun out of --
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
It's the way he said it.
He's your boss. He's not your --
What!
It isn't a broadcast studio.
I know how to get in there.
It's what they said it is.
That was -- different.
Where were you?
Look at this.
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
No.
Great!
You look beautiful.
Milo?
Here we go.
...wanna savor this.
Don't worry, Milo.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
Milo?
What seems to be the problem?
Milo?
You're living here?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
Will I get to work for Outpost?
Okay.
You're interfaced with our dish.
Is it your software?
What?!
...When did you know?
That's gotta kill him, right?
Milo? I'm Danny.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
Who's that?
...Hello?
Cool!
You know a lot about art, I guess.
I've only shown this to three other people.
No!
'Think I should buy some originals?
Could work with a new switch.
How's it going?
It's okay. Really.
You did this -- overnight?
Milo. What's up?
You really wrote this just today?
Everything I do is under scrutiny.
It scales, don't you think?
I heard what happened.
Had you talked to him much lately?
Wow.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler.
Gary, hi.
Why did you move around so much?
No.
That's great! Thanks.
"Dear Lisa.
You could've handwritten it.
Gary, I --
I hope you know what you mean to me.
I'm pretty close.
This is good. Who did it?
What'd the girl say?
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Help me change the Skywire settings.
Okay, #2.
Ready for number three?
All the companies know.
I think you should go.
I know you lost all his work.
Could it be a glitch?
Every entry was authorized.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice.
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
Now what are we doing?
Lisa.
Did I say something?
What've you got there?
Cool!
Did you wanna be alone?
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps.
That's great. I -- didn't know.
I snuck into #21.
I know why you're so secretive.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
...Milo?
What about the FBI?
Do we post it on the Net?
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
Time?
How close are you?
Why were you so careless?
Why were you snooping in my office?
I told Teddy about you.
I felt guilty.
Great.
Does he know you know?
Meet me at the other location.
They know, I had no choice.
Maybe it's the satellite.
...He knows.
Latitude 47 degrees.
...You got my E-mail?
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.
They're in the neighborhood.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
So how'd you like the house?
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa.
What're they building?
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
What is it?
That kid's the great white hope.
Who're these guys?
You seem surprised to see me.
Come in.
May I wash you?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
Hello, Austin.
Where am I?
When do I begin?
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Hello Austin.
She's working on another lead right now.
Hello, Exposition.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Good afternoon, Mr.
What's wrong with your hand?
Dr.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr.
Mr.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh?
Brrrr!
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
Let me guess.
Hey, who put this in here?
I love Las Vegas, man.
I can't see a bloody thing.
Why did you leave so soon?
Good morning, Vanessa!
A limousine has just pulled up.
Hello, hello.
Let's go get him!
I hate having my picture taken.
Fancy a nibble?
Watch out, you're on my hair!
I haven't had fun like that since college.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
I can't. You're drunk.
Really, Austin!
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Hello, luv.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Does that make you horny?
First, I plan to soil myself.
All right, I get it.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
What do we do now?
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.
Follow me!
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I have something to tell you.
Danger Powers, personal effects.
Hi, folks.
Everything seems to be in order.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Don't mind if I do.
Noooooooooooooo!
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three.
Oh my God, he's back.
Commander, I have to log it...
But my design was perfect!
But Dr.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
We've got a lot of work to do.
Ow! You shot me!
Austin Powers is getting too close.
Breathtaking, Frau.
Quite impressive.
Release the sharks!
What is it now?
That was great, Mr.
No, the boy's right.
Actually, the boy's quite astute.
Hi.
An evil vet?
Scott my boy, come here.
Fine.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Um, Dr.
Umm, that also has already happened.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
I'm proud of you.
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
No, it's been too long.
What do you want to do, Scott?
We don't label people here, Scott.
I just think, like, he hates me.
Knight ...
Flower ...
Nature ...
How long have I been here?
Would that I could say the Same.
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
I so agree.
You
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
Mrs.
May I help you, madam ...
You are female?
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Quite a collection.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Congratulations, Mrs.
Close.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
How curious ...
Father will be your controller.
Welcome to mobile H.
London.
I resign.
What are you trying to do to me?
Peter Peel was a first class agent.
Who?
This is an official matter, Mrs.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Ahem.
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
You.
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
That's better.
Such as?
The missing piece of the jigsaw.
Doctor Peel, I presume?
I was about to throw in the towel.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
My father always wanted a boy.
Do you?
I thought we were on our way.
Steed, we really must be --
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
You know what I mean.
But why? What's the point?
Not so much eccentric.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around?
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
Mother and Dr.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Colonel Crabtree.
Elementary, Mrs.
What on earth?
For you, Mrs. Peel.
But
Not quite. This is my field.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Is that what you think?
Do you always drive this fast?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
This must be the last straw.
Steed ... !
Where am I?
You followed me.
I could save you the trouble.
Yes ... ?
And do you trust me?
Mmm ... what are you doing?
But you did suspect me.
No, after you.
I told Mother I took care of you.
Drat.
Very well.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
Aren't you coming?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
There's a reception this evening.
What's that you're wearing?
What is it?
Trubshaw again? What now?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Bad news.
I'll be back ...
Mrs. Peel?
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
Our chaperon.
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Your mission is simple.
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs.
Where's Mother?
You don't believe him?
Emma in Wonderland.
Talk to the pipe, Mrs.
Ah, here we are.
I was getting to it.
'X' marks the spot.
Privately owned by ...
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
We know one thing.
Oh, hello ...
Steed
Mother betrayed me.
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Weather's turning nasty.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art.
Think she really killed those agents?
Something went wrong.
Still doesn't.
This man -- did you see him?
Pity.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Are you alright, young man?
Cocky little bastard.
You with Mother or Father?
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
John Steed.
You're better than I expected.
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
One shot -- for emergencies.
You said ... one shot.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
What's happening?
Does Cole know about this?
I'm totally blown away.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
Debbie.
He still thinks I'm going with him.
That's what we're going to find out...
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
What?
Yeah, man.
Where's the women, man?
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
I've decided not to run for President.
Man, you're losing your audience.
Yes, gentlemen.
All right!
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
And...
Cole.
Seventy-five hundred.
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
I don't want any trouble.
Great car.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Shit, shit, shit, shit.
Rick.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Hello?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Nice shot.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
So, he's playing hard ball.
Cole?
Cole, we've got to talk.
You know how that makes me feel, Deb?
God, you're a slob.
Huh? Wha...
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
That feels so great.
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Have a good time.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.
I can't trust you!
Let go of me!
I don't believe you.
See?
Are you okay?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Let's go.
Why is Cole here?
A strange wang right in my palm.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
I hope Ilene's all right.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding.
Great bathing suit.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
That's it, prick lips.
This is bad public relations.
Give him the works.
Let's go.
Okay.
Wait a minute.
Sounds swell.
Give the guy air.
It's true.
Hookers beat you up?
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
What can I be doing for you?
So, Larry, how have you been?
I hate her.
Is that all the coke in the place?
You want to share it?
My marriage is the worst.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
You okay?
What the hell are you doing?
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
It's my fault.
Are any of those right?
It's on the tenth floor.
Keep your voices down.
You're all under arrest. Open up!
Oops!
Rick, hit the ball easier, son.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
The end.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
Ed... you're kinky!
How are we doing?
Where'd she go?
Where the hell is he?
What's the matter?
What the hell is that?
I think you'll enjoy this table.
I don't get it.
Rick, I'm concerned.
How'd it go?
Who was that?
How 'bout this?
He look familiar?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Hey, you guys...
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
What are you going to do about it?
Reach out and snort someone.
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
Nah, that's okay.
Thanks a lot, that was the best.
You're late again, Rick.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers?
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Oh these moments do try me...
Wash it to the windows?
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Biggest in two battalions.
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
-- Knock it off!
You stupid son of a bitch!
Hey, baby McCaffrey.
Is he...
Did you do it for Tim?
You gotta let me finish --
-- He killed people --
It doesn't go like that.
Well, look what we have here.
Doesn't work on you.
I like what you've done with the place.
Been ripping off fire stations?
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
People actually used to pay you for this?
Why'd you come here, Brian?
There's only so much technology can do.
Ya love it, probie?
Goddamn it Stephen!
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Thanks.
Hey.
Look, Brian, a photographer.
Roll the hose.
What, is it the stairs?
Ready?
You okay?
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
...Not now, Brian.
Hey, what are you doing here?
It's okay, Stephen, I --
I saw it.
-- Stephen, wait a minute.
Anything else?
Brian.
With grenadine, right?
What was that?
Arson.
Hey.
I could use a date.
Hi.
Okay.
Thanks for the invite.
Brian. What's wrong?
Hi.
What is --
I'm sorry.
Brian McCaffrey.
Okay, here's the deal.
Famous story even.
Who the fuck is doing this?
Oh Jesus Christ...
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey.
Are you still here?
Where are you going?
-- Shhh.
So you were happy here.
Read.
Look, it isn't proof, okay?
That's it!
What the hell are you doing here?
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
Did you pull me out?
So what do you want me to do?
Your brother was a good man.
Brian?
'Bout written you off.
That's Sean?
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Yeah. Big fan.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Completely out of control.
Aren't you even curious?
Man.
Do you have to do that?
What?
So, you surviving without me?
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.
Really.
Who's going to die?
Your brother's right.
Fireman shit?
Dad!
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
We gotta roll, Stevie...
You can't talk about my brother like that...
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Where's Sean?
You want some coffee?
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
Cook and I are almost finished here.
Look, I'm sorry I --
Anyway, down here, take a look...
See that patch of shirt?
Shadow.
You don't know him.
Knock it off. Now.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
-- Burn them.
Got a cause?
I'm working on it.
It knows us. This one knows us.
Alderman Swayzak.
Inspector.
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
I'm a little busy right now --
I'm gonna need some bread, man.
It's horrible.
The Church is a fucking racket.
People.
Christ!
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy?
But you could do it, baby.
I got it, man!
You took the chalice.
Are you all right, honey?
So what are you doing here?
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
How are you doing, man?
There.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God.
Large?
Oh, really?
I got them all going for Oakland.
Hey, man.
OK asshole.
Fuck Strawberry.
Do you have the money?
I don't got it.
How's the case going?
Get this, man.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
BLAK OUT.
Keep trying.
...Benedict Arnold...
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
He gots to be did.
You truly are a dancing fool.
Everybody say Ho!
C'mon.
Let's go niggers!
You idiot.
My group we need some exposure.
You don't have the demographics.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place.
We're ready when you are.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.
Life is beginning to look up.
I'm not smiling.
What's that?
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
What's wrong with him?
Please, have a seat.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Good morning, Cheeba.
I have this concept for a TV pilot.
What kind of show is this gonna be?
What about in the mean time?
Nice to meet you.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.
We got evicted from our home.
That ain't funny.
My tap shoes.
What do I have to do?
How different?
I would like to change your name.
Mantan?
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Four minutes ago.
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
I understand Black culture.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man.
What is it you want from me?
Word!!!
I'm feelin' dis'!
That's a great handle.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout.
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.
What do you want?
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
I did.
That's what I'm askin'.
That's the only reason, period.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
Let's get him over to the bed.
I love you too, Daddy.
Glad to meet you, too.
How long has my father been like this?
He never showed it.
How was it?
Manray!
How did you know?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
You lost me.
Maybe something happened to them.
Hello.
You okay?
What is your problem?
This is the group I was telling you about.
You've said that already.
Just want to say good luck.
Your life will never be the same.
Same here.
Who's side are you on?
What would their reaction be?
So you have your small victory, now what?
What is this?
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
Why'd you do that?
DeLa, you should try it sometime.
This is crazy.
Otherwise.
Don't make me have to use this.
I told you but you wouldn't listen.
Yes, your name?
I'm happy for all of us.
That's the way it came out.
Can I kiss you too?
So they can be on TV.
No joke.  Serious.
What are you?
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
How's the food?
It was.
Peerless, your father called.
He wants you to come and see him.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
I'm doing okay.
Nice to meet you.
Where are you from?
A fiasco.
How did you get this gig?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
The Mantan Manifesto.
Let Myrna finish.
Yes you!
I never had a really real pair before.
No, we're not knocking boots.
Money and nothing else?
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
No, not that.  How 'bout...
I heard ya lady is wild.
I fell out of my bed last night.
I feel a song a comin' on.
A lot?
So what's up with you?
This is a nice place.
Why don't you call him?
You're sure this is a good idea.
I'll be down front.
How did you get this gig?
So you say.
Good day to you, young sir.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
There's nothing else for it.
Hoity-toity!
This is a very good inn.
Ah!
Where's the beauty you promised me?
Good morning, Private James.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
Has he sent the challenge yet?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.
Have you taken my message to him?
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Good gracious!  What is this?
I have no luggage.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
The cards are now my only livelihood.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day.
No.
You want my heart?
Will we always leave it at this?
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
I accept, but I insist on a wager.
I feel the ribbon.
Why are you shaking?
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do!
Monster!
I am at your service, Mr.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Does this assignment interest you?
Was he cheated?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
I have good news for you, Mr.
Did you buy the horse, papa?
Good night, papa.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Indeed, you are right, sir.
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth!
Charming Schuvaloff.
Can I at least have a drink?
Hurricane kept you up, too?
Bill Styles...
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
I don't want to go --
Did -- did you --
What about Pike?
He is the only one unaccounted for.
You framed-him...
This isn't our area.
You killed him you fucking faggot --
West was one thing, but this --
What about you, wandering around alone?
Yeah, right...
You too?
Why not?
I don't know... I like the Army.
There's no need...
Right.
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
Some.
You smoke, Ray?
Hey, Ray!
So Childs made some side money, so what?
I apologize --
And he'd been shot.
You shot Childs and Nunez.
We're not finished yet --
We don't need the tapes --
He -- He made me do it --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all.
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
That first night with Pike.
He was sickly.
He said he worked there --
Where?
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Back up.
Where's the cabin?
Is that what I did, now?
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
Cadet, what's your name!
What the fuck is going on?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Jesus, what happened?
So you killed him?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
What do you mean, West's?
Where have you been, Jay?
Roberto, what the fuck?
You know it's not like that --
Right?
You gotta untie me.
Ray, this is my life here.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
Why... why didn't you tell me?
I... I don't know...
You.
That's it.
I've done nothing wrong.
My father is a powerful man.
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that.
He admitted it.
Why did he come back for you?
Okay.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system.
Is it the truth?
Dunbar will testify that you were.
Something funny, Levi?
Why?
How do you know?
Or you, Levi?
How are you?
That bad?
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck".
Which gives us about five hours.
We've already been over the terrain twice.
You mean not enough to save you.
Tom, where are you going --
You want a confession?
What I said before --
It's over.
You think you could explain all this to me?
They're taking your command, aren't they?
I'm sorry, Bill.
Stay where you are.
No more witnesses.
Hostile and uncooperative.
Ah, Christ
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Three things.
Thank you.
Baseball?
What is that?
Typical army brat story.
You're kidding.
Something wrong?
That was kid gloves?
"Too neat.
I just.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
West was a monster!
I was starting to believe you, you know?
Why do you care?
I didn't shoot West...
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
We're fucked, I know --
That's a fantastic idea --
I pushed him too hard.
You wanted to break him.
So what now?
We were close to something with Kendall.
Four --
Hardy, what are you doing --
No bodies, no West...
We need to talk --
What?
This isn't the time --
That's not true.
West?
Do I have a choice in this?
What are you doing out here?
Your phone number?
He was your friend.
How?
Pike, please --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
We should tell him we're not going.
They found him.
Pike and I got separated --
I was freezing from the hurricane --
We just want --
He said what?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Pike never confessed.
Running out of time, are we?
Pike never confessed.
Dunbar says you were.
You and Dunbar got your stories straight.
It doesn't matter, Levi.
It won't work --
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Who, Levi --
I told him what had really happened to West.
What happened with Nunez?
What the fuck happened to you --
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
Thank God...
This place is going, Mueller.
We all know what you did, Pike.
Tell him to shut up --
Sign here and here.
Funny.
So?
This is totally unnecessary --
You think he did it?
What do you think?
You want Kendall, don't you?
What happens to Dunbar now?
Great, great. That's fantastic.
Hey kid!
See! The big guy likes it.
What do you mean?
Someone stole my backpack.
Didn't kill anything, did I?
I was wrong about you kid.
Her name is Sandra Templeton.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
Bloom like a flower?
You were expecting me?
What is this place?
I have to leave. Tonight.
You won't find a better place!
Or are you too scared?
You get the eye?
Bloom!
Will.
Can I see him?
How long have you known my father?
Did you see that woman?
Yeah.
How old are you?
Promise me you'll come back.
You must be Edward Bloom.
In so many words, yes.
Helping people makes me happy.
You're Beamen's daughter.
It's okay, just leave it.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Don't.
Really.
Hi. How are you feeling?
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
He was buttering her rolls.
Spooning the sherbet.
That's because we didn't have a wedding.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
There was one time when I was eleven...
Hardly two stories in the whole place.
Okay.
What did she say?
You know anyone's who's taken it?
You're not trying to run away?
You can see my predicament.
The one about the witch.
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
People needn't worry so much.
When did you ever work in an office?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool.
I thought you weren't dying.
Why not religion, Dad?
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Did I ever tell you about how...
The maple tree and the Buick.
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
What do you want, Will?
The river.
Tell me how it happens.
I can try, Dad.
Let's get out of here.
Where are we headed?
It's unbelievable.
You become what you always were.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
Daffodils?
You don't even know me.
How can I convince you to stop?
I was drying out.
Wait! I need those!
It's me. Norther Winslow.
I don't believe it!
So what are you up to now?
This is it? The whole vault.
Oh. Oh.
Are you Jenny Hill?
How did you know my father?
Were you and my father having an affair?
Can I ask you a question?
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
I spent a week in Morocco for the story.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I'm going to check on him.
I'm sorry.
Do you like it, being pregnant?
It's bad.
I'm going with you.
I talked with your father last night.
You never told me how your parents met.
Mmm.
Do you love your father?
You have to understand.
Look, I know why you like him.
What happened?
How did you get here?
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How is he?
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
I know it's not easy.
Was she one of your teachers?
That really happened?
Is he awake?
Mom?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
You first.
Put it in the cases.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe.
Yeah it was okay.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
It's enough isn't it?
What's this?
Do you like it?
Say thank you.
What?
A baby?
What? What are you doing?
What.
This is sensitive.
Hello.
How's that?
Sorry. You've lost me...
What did he say?
I need to know who you are first please.
Hold on.
So hang on.
No.
So?
What was that?
So how long will you be in England?
She says 'Hello' to you.
She says she has a secret to tell.
When?
Binoculars.
What was that?
You are not ashamed of it?
How is bank?
I understand. I'm so sorry
Put the fucking kettle down.
What did he say? Tell me!
He wants a lot of money.
Oh Jesus.
Just leave her alone.
Is that everything?
It's about forty miles from here.
So.
And how was the flight.
Do uh.
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Today is bath day.
I don't understand.
Syevodnya?
"Frenzy".
They go. John. They go.
Oh, I don't know.
Unless.
So what are you going to do?
Where's the restroom?
You don't have to do this.
Give me some money.
What?
So uh...
Not the kids type then is he?
I don't want to talk about it.
We'll pretend it never happened.
So what?
What?
It wasn't what I wanted.
Excuse me?
Fifteen.
What happened between you and the blonde?
I'm sorry.
What?
She's alive!! She is not dead?
You should stop smoking.
I don't know.
You know you can come under the blanket.
I've got an hour.
Yeah. No thanks.
Okay. Goodbye.
Something else.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
It's not mine.
Why?
What does it mean?
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
My name's Sophia.
Is the flight full?
You have excellent English.
What are you doing?
Lazarus?
Angela?
Is your niece older than 12?
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia.
Thank you.
I brung you a little basket of goodies.
This was very sweet of you.

There you go, preacher man.
Heard about this morning.
Yeah, you know you home, old man.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
Keep the change on that.
So...  That your first time?
I skipped lunch.
Thank you.
You a preacher?
It starts like this.
This ain't gonna work.
Hey.
Well.
I feel better. Do you?
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
What happened to your face?
You got any money?
I think she got to you, pappy.
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
Wait up.
He works for Frank Abolofia.
What's this?
Back-up.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
... I found the goombah.
What are they doing now?
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
Frank Abolofia.
Some party.
What are you doing?
I call, right?
What'd you say?
Nick... You up?
Nick, have I been a good partner?
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
Let's go.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto.
This should be it...
This the right place?
Getting very weird.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
Squid?
Joyce can be nice.
You cool, Ich?
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
Short shift?
Are you expecting anyone?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Where're you going, Ichiro?
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire.
... We got to keep looking.
Nick!
What happened?
It may be too soon to talk about it.
You must leave?
I've continued working on the case!
How'd you get this?
Know her?
What's he saying?
You said you could keep up with her!
What'd I tell you?
Did I say that?
You're doing fine, Ich.
Nick...
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Yakuza.
She disappeared... shit!
You can't come in.
I'm not drunk...
... A Godfather.
Ich, my name is Nick.
Nick!
Where does this Sugai live?
It's very small.
What's in the box?
No...
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
Start it.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
You did great, Ichiro.
Someone attacked him.
Thank you.  You have one?
What's that for?
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
You all right?
Louder, pal, louder.
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Don't give him any more.
Ich said you left.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
Look, you need Ich.
She ever pull down her shades?
Don't be an ass.
I need your help, Joyce.
I've heard of Sugai.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
Where's the wife?
They want your autograph.
We're in?
You'll get Ich killed.
I still think you're a bastard.
Can't make you change your mind?
Keep the change.
I like your friend, Joyce.
This is my stop.
How big a package we talking about?
One guy do all the damage?
Doesn't speak a word of English.
It's not your job.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.
I want a gun.
Could you fill me in?
Because I want you to tell me.
What's this?
Hey...!
Your plane leaves at six.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.
I took Kobo from the street.
Why tell me this?
With these?
Good.
That wasn't our deal.
Can't thank you enough, Mr.
We're not used to the big city.
He knows what he's doing.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.
Let's go while there is still time.
What's the point?
One man.  He must be good.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
Yeah.
I want more life, fucker.
The facts of life.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
I've done some questionable things.
I like a man who stays put.
Why are you staring at us?
What, Sebastian?
What generation are you?
Show me something?
We have a lot in common.
He's not really my friend.
You're our best and only friend.
Where are you going, Sebastian?
What's going on down there?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
I think, therefore I am.
I want to do it.
Six, huh?
You got a machine on it yet?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.
Yeah.
She was gonna get away.
I didn't like her.
Look, go home.
Yeah.
Take a number.
If you don't, we will.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Well, when do you get paid?
You equipped for random questions?
Here's something you might find interesting.
Yes?
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
I think I have no money.
Prosit.
You want to see my friends?
Those cockroaches?
How long you had these guys?
Prosit.
You like to kiss her goodbye.
I like you.
How old am I?
My birthday is April 10, 2015.
I'm great.
Don't make me laugh.
What's that?
Love is just another name for sex.
Nerves of steel.
During the road test...
But you haven't put in for emigration.
Why didn't you go?
My job is here.
Taffey Lewis?
Book the good ones for where?
Yeah?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
It that mother real?
The best.
Jeezus!
Me.
It's artificial?
Are you apprehensive?
I wouldn't accept it.
I'd take him to the doctor.
Last question.
Is there anything else?
There's two reasons a man rejects help.
You use your equipment, don't you?
Do I make you nervous?
I can imagine.
Don't just stand there looking at me.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
I told you I'd come back.
Who is this?
How come you're not on the job?
What do people do in the afternoon?
Do you dream?
Did you cry when your father died?
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
They could clean around the arrangement.
This feels stupid.
You're sick, Deckard.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Don't leave here.
You know what I think?
Where the hell you been?
Bad?
Thanks.
Is this to be an empathy test?
May I ask a personal question?
Well?
How many questions did it take?
She didn't know?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Already had I.
What?
But I understand what you mean.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
How come you were in my truck?
What's your name?
You want to go home?
Where are your folks?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
I'm hungry, J.F.
Whatcha doin'?
You look... better.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Twenty.
Methuselah Syndrome.
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
What makes you think so?
Hi!
Oh, now, that's a great one!
This is my new friend...
We work on Rodeo Drive.
You're kidding!
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Let's go talk first, Adam.
The key to my hotel room!
How do you do?
Please excuse this interruption.
Cliff, I must warn you.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Get out of here!
Where are we going?
What's wrong with you?
I came on a bus.
So far?
I'm sorry!
Wait!
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
Wait!  Wait!
How's that?
Hey, what are you doing?!
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
That was...wonderful!
I am so glad to see you!
Why are you doing that?
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I knew this would happen!
Troy?
See, ya.
...Okay.
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Wait! Wait!
Well, another day, another dollar.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
Well.
When do you need her by?
Could we talk about that a little later?
Get out!
Now, get out!!
You almost got us killed!
Why, thank you!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
Yeah, right!
Where's he gone?
All right.
The what?
The guy with the underpants!
About clothing?
He's going to kill himself.
Hey, Eve!
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
No!  Not crazy!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
I thought I was here to meet women.
What have you ordered?
What about her?
Okay. I like that.
Really?
That's ridiculous.
Yeah.
What?
You wanted to see me!
Adam?!
I don't blame you!
I'm leaving, too.
Eve?!
There.
Adam.
Uh-huh. Adam?
That's right.
Hi, Eve!
Adam.
No.
Is that a birthday cake?!
Is this because of the radiation?
Good evening.
Are you all right?
I've got almost everything we need!
This is what money looks like.
These are wonderful.
No, no!
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Well, do we just go on up?!
Helen-Thomas-Webber!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Also.
But, I don't understand.
This is great son, just great.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant!
You have very nice ceilings.
It's a very small place.
Right on the button.
That's right?
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Well, we try.
This must be very new.
Not on him.
Why did you park way back there?
What?!
Yes!
I'm sorry.
Okay, Troy!
Good-bye, Adam.
Bye, Troy!
You dial nine to get out.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
What?  What is it?!
Help you?
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Sure.
Whatcha looking at?
Hello.
Sir?
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
Elbows, Son.
Dad!
He seems to be doing all right now.
I'm afraid you've got to.
Right.
Yes?
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
We have to go.
This is your bedroom?
Oh, my God!
You got a light, honey?
For Pete's sake, Calvin!
It's time.
It shuts off automatically.
You hear that?!
How long will we have to stay down here?
Home sweet home!
What's that noise?
To go up.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
Burnt to a crisp.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
No.
Oh, no.
Is there a problem?
No.  I think it's just right.
Calvin?!
Watch this!
Yes, you certainly will.
Hi, honey!
Calvin!
Get the presents and do the lights.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
What did you wish for, Adam?
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Let's eat our cake.
If we still have one.
In the generator room again?
Should we say a little prayer first?
Yes, yes it is!
I'm going to give it to you straight.
Others are.
For how long?
He's smart.
How long will you set it for this time?
Well, please excuse us!
What are you bitching about now?
You came back for these?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
So where is your roommate, the model?
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Stop it, you two!
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
Give me your hand.
I don't know.
You're serious, aren't you?
Alright, I will.
Well, what do you think?
How 'bout it, Eve?
That water's freezing!
Just be yourself.
Are you kidding?
Um... Eve?
Go to the bathroom.
He go back to the hotel?
What's that mean?
What's it to you?!
Where are you going?
What are you going to do?
I don't think so.
Well what was I supposed to do?
Oh, no!
Gay.
What do you want to do with it?
What's wrong?
Millions upon millions upon millions!
Adam!!
I miss those nice flower-power kids.
I'm selling this place.
Tower.
Wolf One -- say intentions.
Tower, say again!!
I sent a trunk home yesterday.
I think it's important not to get depressed.
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick.
I don't want to talk about it.

Do you like that?
Do you like talk like that?
Don't.
Don?
Thank you. honey.
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you like me?
I made it go down the toilet.
Next Christmas.
Hi, can I come in?
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
I liked being with you last night.
Oh shit.
Nice guy. Who's he?
Oh God.
Look.
Who is Don?
Come in.
It used to make me laugh, but.
Do you like my body?
What do you want to do?
You like to open me, don't you?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
Wait a minute.
I love you Don with all my heart.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I guess I should go.
I'll call you.
Oh no.

Where have you been?
They hurt his head.
Hold me, Don.
Frank gone?
Hello, baby.
MOMMY!
Who's this fuck?
Where are we going, Frank?
Look at these. What are these?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead.
Frank, he didn't mean it.
We're looking for him.
Hello?
No thanks.
Heineken.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Hey? You like to walk.
What are you lookin' at?
Come on.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
What time are visiting hours?
I'm going out for awhile.
Can I use the car tonight?
God, you scared me.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont.
I was sorry to hear about your father.
He comes over to study.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
No.
No, you're right.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Hi Dad.
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
Yeah, how did you know?
Oh yeah?
That's the building.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
What happened to him?
I've gotta go in.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I don't want to cause any trouble.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Okay, I'm going ahead.
Are you alright?
So, what's next?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick.
What's the plan.
That sounds good.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
Okay, thanks.
Well, how did it go? What happened?
What's with Mike?
You want a Dairy Queen?
You want to tell me about it?
Okay, be careful.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You were late.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
You worry about me really?
Great.
Everything okay?
I should never had gotten you going on this.
Okay.
What was that all about?
You want to dance?
You want to dance?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
My father has a gun at home.
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Take her to my house.
Jeffrey? What's going on?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Look Jeffrey.
Mike's gotta go.
What are watchin' this junk for?
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Come on out a minute, okay?
What did he bring him in for?
Fuck you.
Hey, I just...
There's ways around that.
Lord's name.
Are ya ready?
Yes sir.
Paraffin came up positive.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Look, look!
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
Oh, God!
Poppa Joe said there was only two.
What did you do?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Anybody you think is evil?
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
Pack your shit!
What did I fuckin' do?
Anybody see ya?
Yeah, well...
What the fuck are you doing?
What? What is it?
Oh man.
Who the fuck was he, Rocco?
Look again for fuck sake!
Shit.
They got nothing.
You little fuck.
You guys?
Hello.
Mother, is that you?
It's all your fault.
What?! What are you doin'?
No ma! No!
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Yeah, we promise.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
You guys are not under oath, here.
We're alive.
What are you going to do?
Hold this shit for us, Doc.
Would someone please come over here and...
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
Hey Murphy?
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
Oh, Jesus.
All right, love ya ma.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
I have no idea.
Absolutely not.
Destroy all that which is evil...
Know what we need, man?
Is that right, Rambo?
Nervous?
See.
Where the fuck are you going?
We're doing some serious shit here.
That was way easier than I thought.
Nine bodies.
Where are you goin'?
Who did you kill?
So what do you think?
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
Give the guy a shot.
There he goes.
He isn't to be touched.
Now, you will receive us.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems.
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
Holy shit.
And number three, Dolly.
So, what do we do now?
She was in here when it went down.
Only two did the shooting.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
And it's the same story over here.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
No!
What?
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
So what are you thinkin' here?
Now stay with me, boys.
Jesus.
These two fucking scenes are related.
That's one big fuckin' shoe!
Who the...
How many bodies, Greenly?
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
They weren't related.
What the...?
Oh my god!
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Promise me boys.
Right now.
This is some heavy shit.
You fuckin' guys.
Hey.
Fuck it!
Hello?
Hello?
Hurry the fuck up!
Those rat fucks!
Liberating isn't it?
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Worst day of my life, man.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
You bet your ass he will.
Hey!
We'll keep going, Roc.
Hello? You there?
Has he now?
You're right.
Don't do this my son.
Father, I'll do you right here.
Do your thing Father.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
Continue the joke.
Well, it's the funny man.
I'm Rocco.
What color hair does he have?
Why?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Now that window can never be locked.
She's really kind of hot.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
The list, Dignan.
Where are you going?
Did you see that?
It had an alarm.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
But he didn't say anything.
Is it back in?
Loop around real fast.
OK.
Now.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Dignan, calm down.
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Where's the manager?
Is that the manager?
Holy shit.
What about what that guy said?
I swear to God.
What's wrong with him?
Can I get that credit card from you?
See if mine are in there.
Really.
I'll just say it.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Look, man.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut.
No, Dignan.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
May I have a word with you, please?
What the fuck is going on here?
She's from Cuba.
He needs to hire an attorney.
Now that makes sense.
See, now we've got a plan.
He's gone. He stole the car.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
He went back for his brother.
When'd he tell you?
Why don't you come with us.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I wish I'd been there.
Man.
I have an idea for that.
I think we better go home.
Sixteen dollars.
I had to give some to Inez.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper!
When'd you get back?
Who's in the car?
Applejack would of got him anyway.
I want you to look at this.
Mr.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
What time did he say to be here?
You could give somebody a concussion.
What do you think?
Dignan. Take it easy.
He doesn't want to fight.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Shit, Dignan.
God.
Next week we'll be drinking pia coladas.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
He was a nice guy.
Do you like Inez?
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
Uh-huh?
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
I don't know.
What's happening? What's going on?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Freeze!
Help me move him.
Who tripped the alarm?
What are you doing?
Wait for Kumar.
You're kidding.
Come on.
Dignan, it's too late.
Like amnesia.
You think Applejack knew?
Why?
You're living on a sailboat?
Where?
Does it float?
So how is it in there? 
What's he in for?
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
You mean like techniques?
I'd like to live in that place.
You mean a safecracker?
Look at that woman.
Tell me something.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
That was a test?
How does that feel?
Did Dignan take the test?
I'll tell you, Anthony.
This is good.
But you're thieves.
We're renegades from despair.
Future Man.
Did you ever steal a car before?
What do herbs have to do with it?
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
Could you grow cinnamon?
Let them fight.
Are you serious?
See you.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop?
Where you going?
Why don't you just tell them the truth.
Will you guys shut up?
You think he got my license plates?
How long are they going to hold him?
Anthony, I --
What?
Bob, where you going?
It took six months of research.
Was Future Man adopted?
Let's not even talk about it.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Give him a second.
You OK, Bob?
No, I know.
What are you doing?
Jesus, Bob.
Yeah.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
It's in the driveway.
How do you say nineteen?
Were you born in Mexico?
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
What?  What?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Where'd they come from?
Is that him?
That's Anthony.
Wait. Did he see us?
Mr.
What?
Are you a fag?
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard.
Well, what do you think?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
He looks like he was designed by scientists.
You stole a Trans-Am.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
What was that all about?
The guy is fucking insane.
Where'd she go?
I think we might of scared her.
I'm going to take a look at this.
Bob.
I paid for it.
He doesn't get it.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone.
What are you doing?
What happened?
How much is there?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
You really think he'll remember you?
Bob, will you please listen?
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob.
Way to go, Bob!
In all probability nothing would of happened.
Shit, Bob.
Is he chasing us?
I'm sure he did.
Bob. Are you coming?
You can go first, Bob.
The weed.
How long has he been in there?
What do you mean get back?
Give me the keys, Dignan.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
Dignan.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Right. It was extremely stupid.
You said 48 hours!
Come on!
It wasn't your fault, Bob.
I'm sorry, Bob.
That's OK.
Come on, Bob.
Scarecrow?
Everything OK?
I couldn't hear anything.
What's wrong with Applejack?
Is he breathing?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
The elevator broke.
Applejack drove.
Do you have your own room?
Do they let you --
Hold on --
How's that 700 bucks coming?
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
I might have mentioned it.
How you doing, Bob?
You keeping out of trouble?
Your brother was up here the other day.
How long do you have to go?
Ground defense.
Dignan.
Is he in?
What do you mean grammar?
The grammar?
Is he good?
Join the party, fellas.
You got to have fun with it.
Where did he go?
What's the story?
We're closed, sir.
Where is he? Where is Rob?
Hello, my friend.
You like Chicanos?
You a good pool player.
I don't know.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
No. Just pool.
How's the weather down there?
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
The world needs dreamers, son.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
You told me Bourne was dead.
Neski was a roadblock.
Leaving was a business decision.
He left yesterday on the night train.
Treadstone.
And what are we looking for?
Let's talk about Conklin.
Berlin!
Call a Mayday into Berlin station.
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Sorry to wake you.
What?
Moscow?
Sit down.
Sir...
She say what time I should call?
Who else knows about this?
Sit.
It's nice.
I would want to know.
It changes things.
It was my job.
They loved you.  And I killed them.
It doesn't matter.
I have to go now.
I emptied it.
Front. Use your teeth.
You still should've moved.
So why didn't you kill me then?
What do you want?
Try again.
You're lying.
She really did that?
You called it in?
-- car keys?
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
Sleep. Sleep now.
No... How?
But you're sure?
That's crazy.
You drive.
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
You keep going to the shack.
I love you, too.
I wanted to kill him.
I know it's a dream.
God, I miss you.
See that tram coming around the corner?
Why is she trying to kill me?
How do they know that?
Say it.
And you got to him before we could.
What was Landy buying?
Why are you here, then?
No... Jason... please...
It's me.
What do you want?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Where am I?
Oh, shit...
Why am I alive?
Thank you for your gift.
Don't need it. I remember everything.
We need to get in there.
Looks like he's been detained.
-- go -- take the van! --
Alright... take it down.
You're sure?
Show me.
This is everything? Is there.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
I'm here.
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam.
Mr. Nevins?
How long have you worked for the agency?
What kind of problems?
Good luck.
I'm curious about Bourne.
Is it fresh?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
Let's give him half an hour.
Do we know what this says?
Anything?
Black coat, possibly leather.
Here's what I've got.
We're looking at all Berlin outbound.
Someone dead from this household?
We'll sleep here tonight.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection?
What are they doing?
But... what will you do?
A thousand.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
Young Robert, we are honored --
A wise plan.
Does anyone know his politics?
He won't come.
Longshanks promised!
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
What news of the north?
Wallace has sacked York!
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
Now we kill two birds at one stroke.
His legend grows!
What is it?!
Shut up, would you!
No, M'lord.
Now, my flower, do you understand?
Good day to you, M'Lords.
The little cow is insane --
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
Nor you.
I'll wait... back there.
We make spears.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Stephen ready?
Thanks for the food and drink.
Rest, William.
You know it's a trap.
Keep these. We're going too.
They're coming!
Wanna stay with me tonight?
Test of manhood.
I still say this is no test.
Can you do it when it matters?
You'll move
Good to see you again.
All right, Father, I'll ask him!
Excellent!
We must run in different directions!
I am the one who is rotting.
Where is my son?
No.
I have faced him. Have you?
Treason. Against whom?
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
You've been here before?
I want... to marry you!
I've missed you.
Then when?
I'm dreaming.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace?
I am the Princess of Wales.
Let us talk plainly.
I understand you have suffered.
A meeting in a barn.
Why did you?
You have... you have a husband.
You understand.
You will die! It will be awful!
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
Wait!
I'm no coward!
War finds me willing.
We can't stop!
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
Thank you for showing it to me first.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
No dances, just tell me.
We're gonna be late again.
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
Darn it!
All the dads are gonna be there.
I don't like this place, Mom.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
What happened?
I don't know... I don't remember.
Please, mom. People will talk.
Why do you ask?
I found these.
Okay, doc.
What does that mean for Evan?
There must be a way to fix this.
You're. Acting. Like your father.
How. Did you. Know that?
Just. Like. Jason.
Best not bitch up.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
What did you see?
Hello, Evan.
Dad lives here?
Okay.
Go on.
It's a little complicated.
Hey, Evan.
Think Evan.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
Are you stupid or what?
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Get out. Both of you.
We should go soon.
Oh God... what did we do?
I'm sorry Kayleigh.
Ouch.
It's not your fault.
I deserve a lot worse.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Welcome home.
God, Evan!
Not since we were kids.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Just shut up, Evan.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Where... where are my clothes?
Oh my God, that was good.
I don't know what to say.
Why are you doing all this for me?
It's my fault.
Are you okay?
Wait.
Evan, stop!
I want you to take this, Lenny.
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
What's happened to you?
I just thought you should know.
There's one major hole in your story.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
Where are we going?
Is something the matter?
Kayleigh?
We're really gonna be in a movie!
Where am I?
What time is it?
Easy does it, Evan!
That's dangerous!
It's okay.
Are you okay?
You can't play God, son.
Evan, you're hysterical.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
I'm not sure.
Whoa!
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
Remember, everyone!
So what's the point?
Smells like sex in here.
Freeze!
Come on, go on...
It didn't feel like a dream.
Can... can... Can I have this?
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
I couldn't cut the rope.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Are you sure you even packed it?
What do you need it for?
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here.
Hurry!
Look what you made me do!
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
What the hell are you doing?
Listen to me good, Evan...
I did what you said, man!
Lung cancer?
Mom.
Just get out, didja?
Evan, guess what?
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Lenny? Come on!
Shut up, Tommy!
You put the mommy too far away.
Here you go, buddy.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Monsieur Rick?
How did you get in here?
No, of course not.
How long have you been married?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
Monsieur Rick, I --
You will find a market there for this ring.
Good.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
I see.
The police break up our meeting.
Yes, I come.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Here you are.
Here's to you, sir.
Er, goodbye, sir.
Hello, Rick.
I see the bus is in.
The bourbon.
Of course not.
I will stay here and keep on trying.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.
Do you know where they are?
Rick?
And Mademoiselle?
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
Who are you really?
A franc for your thoughts.
Richard, they'll find out your record.
My German's a little rusty.
Strange. I know so very little about you.
But be serious, darling.
That's too far ahead to plan.
Well, why not?
Oh.
Please.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Why did you come back?
How did you get in?
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once.
No.
-- All right.
And then?
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard.
I can't fight it anymore.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
But why my name, Richard?
No, Richard, no.
I'm saying it because it's true.
Yes.
Hello, Sam.
It's been a long time.
Where is Rick?
When will he be back?
You are very kind.
This time they really mean to stop me.
I must find out what Berger knows.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Yes, I see.
He does.
What happened with Rick?
Our faithful friend is still there.
Don't joke.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on.
Did he give any reason?
Ilsa, I --
Yes, Victor, I was.
Yes, Yes I know.
Be careful.
Are you ready Ilsa?
Hello, Rick.
Well then, perhaps you also ---
I can't get over you two.
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
How do you do?
And I congratulate you.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
We'll come again.
Good morning.
Good evening.
Well, this might come in handy.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine?
I wonder if you do.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
Everything in order?
I understand.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
No, Captain, please.
Let us say that it is my request.
My bill.
Well!
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
I am delighted to see you both.
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
I am making out the report now.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
You will give us the names?
For the time being.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Oh, there is no hurry.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Especially so tonight, Major.
Ho, diplomatist!
Rick is completely neutral about everything.
Mademoiselle.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca.
You see what I mean?
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Why do you stand here?
Hello, Louis.
The plane to Lisbon.
It was a combination of all three.
I see.
How observant you are.
Is that a serious offer?
Yeah, you were saying?
Oh, how do you do?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Oh, no, Rick never --
Oh, it's my party.
Well, Ricky.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
How can you close me up?
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.
I see.
You're late.
I have the letters right here.
-- Not so fast, Louis.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
Where were you last night?
Give me another.
Make it official, if you like.
Are my eyes really brown?
You'll excuse me, gentlemen.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Hello?
Uh, excuse me, please.
Huh.
May I?
Thank you.
One moment.
Rick! Rick, help me!
Boss!
They grab Ugarte and she walks in.
What's that you're playing?
And getting closer every minute.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
It's bad.
Save some for tomorrow.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Get up.
Can't.  Need water.
No more water, you said.
Polaris, where are you?
You're putting off the inevitable.
Get water!
You're beautiful.  Marry me.
What are you doing?
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
Look, just slip off the raft.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.
What are you smiling about?
They're never going to see you.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
What's so damn funny?
Jesus.
It's real.
You can't make it.
You came on a bicycle?
You know what happened to this?
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
I can't believe this.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
What brings you out to the sticks?
Yeah, a long one.
Sonofabitch!
Your eyes are puffy.
How was Russia?
Got to follow the paper path here.
Chuck.
Merry Christmas eve.
Four four.  A record.
Hey, look at you.
He is a cute thing.
You know, for when you travel.
I have to go.
Look, I love the puppy.
This isn't working out.
That's your dog.
I'm sorry about the presents.
Get back?  From where?
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
I got married.
I didn't want to.
Her name's Hannah.
What's that?
What's that, written on the sail?
There was a coffin?
Come on.  Try.
You hated being alone.
This is so unfair.
You okay?
What will you do?
I've got to get back to Memphis.
I love you, Chuck.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
When's the next Jumbo?
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
I am one lucky guy.
If you say you are.
Yes, yes he did.
Doc, I'm not on the island.
Need some help?
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
I used to drive one of those.
You're Chuck Noland.
Thought you were going to bring her.
But chickens?
Really?
What happened to your pants?
Look, I help take care of the place.
Mom, this is a farm.
Maybe I should take a few days off.
When'd you start working here?
I've got all this back pay coming.
What a journey you've had.
Trying.
Okay.
Hmmm.
Kamal is not here.
How'd it go?
You what?
I didn't know we had sailboats.
And never take.
You are one sick fucker.
Malaysia's tanking.
Hello?
God damn!
I beat the odds!
Hello.
How about we go somewhere else?
This stinks really bad.
Cool ropes.
You were how long on this?
To Wilson.
I'm serious.
To life.
Digital laser readers.
Take your time.
Not just that.
What, then?
Thanks.  For everything.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Only if you can afford it.
I was dreaming about you.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
They want to replace me!
He'll need clothes... some money...
This is *your* life story, Wilbur!
These *credentials* are against the law!
Oh my, yes!
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him.
He *sniffs* that ether!
I mean your parents.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
What's she so emotional about?
What'd she die of?
What are you going to tell the little ones?
It's time somebody ate *them*.
It's gettin' late.
Good night, kids.
So, Mrs...
How many months are you?
Is your family in the apple business, too?
I know.
I guess I'll see you around the orchards.
So. Not bored yet?
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
I better go.
A movie *outside*?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
But you looked as if you liked it.
And what did she die of, exactly?
What's the *medical* explanation?
You're a natural.
The screen is enormous!
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
You don't miss it?
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
I *know* this was right.
Just tell me.
Olive told me.
Do you think I'm having a good time?
We should take her to St.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Just tell me.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
Stop it! Just cut it out!
I know, I'm sorry.
Please don't make me say it again.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally.
Do you think she'll be all right?
This came for you a couple of days ago.
How is that Wally doing?
Hi...
I know where you can go.
You can trust me.
So many children. Are they all orphans?
I'm okay--I can walk.
Wally thinks apples are boring.
There! You said it was boring.
I love you, Wally.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
I thought they might take me.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
That's a heavy sedation.
I don't know!
So here is my candidate.
I just wanted to ask you...
Is *your* father dead?
"I was a posthumous child.
Uh... it's the end of October.
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
Did you bite it?
I'm sorry.
What kind of plane are you flying?
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
This is all normal.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
At what altitude?
They're migrants.
It's almost like flying.
So. What should I do now?
Stop it, Homer.
That's better.
Are we supposed to be up here?
But she's your *daughter*...
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
What business is you in, Homer?
What's that? What's it called?
I'm stayin', Homer.
Let me hear you say that!
First pregnancy?
There was no visible wound?
It's obviously an aborticide.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
Fuzzy is not uncommon.
Where's the name sheet?
He doesn't like it.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
I thought you took care of this.
I thought it was my turn.
I am not a doctor.
Uh... sure.
Good-bye, Arthur.
"One: Please don't smoke in bed.
Rose Rose?
What's that?
There's a little something wrong with it.
Do you like to read?
I'm not in trouble.
Give men that.
You okay, Rose?
You're not yet three months, are you?
That's *it*?
Who cares?
Do you know him?
Then it's malaria?
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
They told me I was too old to serve.
Don't this place look like home?
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
Where's your manners?
*What* view?
She's *good* with that knife!
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
Where do you think you're going?
You just go inside, Homer.
Rose Rose has runned away!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
But I'm not that late.
Thanks for playing along.
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
So, what do you do?
Can --
So we've been meeting with banks all day.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
Uh, right.
Here's where a little research comes in handy.
We had to finalize the deal.
What's this?
Let's just slow down for a second...
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Same thing with playing a con.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Grifters...
I'm not saying anything.
Keeping the Fix happy.
So how'd you get caught?
I can see why you liked her.
But there were other factors.
He's just as crooked as the next guy.
Nice.
Thanks.
She had you tempting fate.
Is that what it was, Jake?
So much for honor among thieves.
We were back on.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Alright.
Oh, Jake.
Not that I recall.
Ten is standard, sir.
Who's that?
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young.
Whoa. What?
Fuck that. We're going too.
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him.
Masters of our own destiny.
Jake...
I'm going home
Moonan. Here. Shit...
That's it?
Shit.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
It can buy you a new and better you.
You know what we're doing with the money.
When?
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
How much we going after?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
She up for this?
She got one leg out from under him.
Uh.
We're going to make it back, Grant.
You'll be there?
Jake --
So that's it...
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Grifter huh?
Minus one.
Honest mistake.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid.
Why?
How much?
That's more than you already owe me.
Listen, Scooter --
Excuse me?
Look at you, you skinny prick.
Come here. Feel this.
Come on. Harder.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Don't get me wrong, Jake.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Oh yeah.
Kennedy.
Sorry, I --
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake?
Attractive girl.
Thank you, sir.
I lost my head.
I can't be here!
Oh Jesus!
What -- What do we do?
What about... The money?
What is this? You guys cops or something?
That's not --
We have work.
Alright!
We had to see what your deal was.
No.  What's my cut?
What about Customs?
Mr. King, I think --
What the hell's his problem?
You need to get a haircut.
Uh... Everything okay?
He's gone.
You told me to change my hair!
We're getting down to the wire.
Look at you... You want to go.
You have really soft hands.
How do you deal with --
He wasn't my boyfriend.
No, we never got busted.
He was looking out for you.
Shit, what was that guy's name?
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
No.
Jesus... Take it easy.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
What about...
So there it is.
Sorry. I didn't know...
You got my cell. Leave a message.
What do you get, Lily?
You tell them the "Tale".
Tick-tock...
Stop waving that thing around.
Yeah.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast.
It's bad luck.
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
Meet me at my place later.
You better hurry.
We're working for the King.
No.
Why?
Uh...
Is it all fugasi?
Him.
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
So this is our boss, right?
What do we do? We change the scam?
No, no, no!
Feeling lucky today, Miles.
And we got rid of the red head.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
A ring for my wife.
King ain't gonna like this.
What'd he say?
So that's it, huh?
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
You really like that bitch don't you?
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
What happened?
Aces, Suits.
Can I speak to you in confidence?
The King?
Still time.
Ten percent.
The King, huh? Nice going.
Just a tip.
What?
Coupla things.
Speak.
Special Agent?
Did he buy it?
You guys awake?
Who?
Good.
He's headed towards the eastern most exit.
You sell it.
Hope so.
Bullshit it's cosmetic!
You trust this Moonan guy?
What are you doing?
I'm Bella.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
You're shaking.
I hate cheats.
I've been watching you work.
The Indian rope-trick.
Ouch.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Reynolds got a doctor in.
What are you laughing at?
What kind of deal you looking to?
How about fifteen hundred?
Three years, two months. March '93.
Hi-ya.
I thought it was you.
I found her in bed with someone.
I don't gamble.
Last hand.
I get it.
Good night?
I couldn't resist them.
No, no.
You really are a beautiful woman.
Where did you get it?
You're my prisoner.
In a casino.
You sold the car.
Are you trying to read my palm?
What's the time?
How did it go?
You're shaking. What is it?
I loved it blond.
When you get home, I'm asleep.
Where've you been?
You're my conscience.
What are you doing here?
I don't like it.
The door, Jack.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
That girl, she works at the casino --
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
What?
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
How did you know I was here?
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
Here...use a spoon.
Why did you take the money?
Great.
Don't be stubborn.
So how are you doing, dad?
I've lived there.
Oh hello.
To coincidence.
I'm not married.
How did you hurt your hand?
Jani, there's something I want to say.
He doesn't gamble.
What happened?
Which side do you like?
I'm in trouble.
They mean it.
You don't have to be criminal.
And I thought you were only after my body.
Next time it'll be my neck.
I want you to forget what I said.
How much do you owe?
I'm sorry.
Is it yes?
It doesn't seem fair.
And your hand too.
Would you like a drink?
I don't think we should meet again.
Hello...
Jani! Where are you?
Detective Inspector Ross.
Of course I recognised him!
You've been avoiding me.
Nice car.
Where to?
Where do you live, Jack?
I'm going over the river.
So how do you feel, your first night?
I'm off to a little watering hole.
What are you, a cop?
Who are these guys?
Does Bella come here?
Hey Jack, join us.
I'm off. I need to sleep.
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
Rough day?
What happened to Bella?
What?
You don't recognise me?
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here.
You've been recommended by the management here.
Where did you go to school?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
You use two alternating, don't you?
Haven't you forgotten something?
Not with your own cloth.
How many aces are left?
What makes you so sure?
You want me to check?
Let me just run through a few things.
Next point.
Girlfriend?
This is our Crow's Nest.
You can start Monday week.
I just want the job.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
Thanks for the information.
How do you feel, Jack?
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
There she is.
What's he doin'?
The key!
The key, goddamit, the key!
It didn't go off.
We've got to disarm the bomb.
What was that, I didn't hear...
What the hell?
Well... now what?
Hey, Doolittle, here's one.
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Rechannel all safety relays --
Talby, Talby, can you read me?
Armed.
Fail safe in lock.
Everything sounds fine, bomb.
But you can't explode in the bomb bay.
You are false data.
Snap out of it, bomb.
Hey, bomb...
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Well of course I exist.
That's all beside the point.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Pinback...
New star.
What are you gonna name it?
Commander Powell would have named it.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- open circuit breakers --
I'm coming in now.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
TALBY!
I need a diameter approximation.
You know what I think about, Talby?
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Doolittle! Help me.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Oh yeah?
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix!
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle.
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
Commander? Are you still there?
Men... men... what happened, men?
Who are you?
Okay, okay.
Mr.
No wire.
I never woulda done it.
You're attractive, you're smart.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Fine.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Move it.
How're ya doin', Max.
Do you know why I went after Justine?
Why would I be pissed?
What are you doing here?
What is it?
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Lemme put some clothes on.
Out there.
But I'm afraid of--
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
What're you lookin' at me for?
Where'd you clip this?
What're you looking for?
I shouldn't do this.
You're light a deuce.
I made you coffee.
What a creep.
What's with you?
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
Damn... Are you alright?
Goodnight Bears.
What makes you cry?
Sophy?  Are you okay?
You're a thief?
You have good taste.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
Sorry about your window.
Lemme get my coat.
How'd you find me?
Whoa there, Tex!
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
We got separated right away.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
What's this?
It turned up on the black market.
That was taken nine years ago.
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
Know where I can find her?
Max something.
Who is it?
Who are you?
This is not a place you wanna go.
Say the words, "I understand."
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
I got a hit on the car.
Who's this guy?
She was a nurse.
What about the other kids?
As long as you're okay.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.
Your fiance has four previous wives.
Morning, Sunshine...
That's odd...
Tell me the truth.
Gotta go.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Not right now.
Who are you?
Make the call.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
Playing hooky again?
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Catch you back at the wall.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
Hey, Sketchy--
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
That was extreme!
This is a hot run.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.
What about this?
Thanks, miss.
What the hell is that?
Well.
You love him?
What's that?
Sure, I have.
Whoa... she is a killer.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
No problem.
Sorry.
Jeremiah?
Beth? I can't believe it.
We've got to take this slow...
So.
Ann Arbor?
I feel like such an idiot.
Coming dad.
Oh, great.
Tease?
What are you, high?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Namely?
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing?
What was that D.J.'s name again?
I have one question.
So maybe we got enough for one ticket.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Any luck?
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Second floor girls' john!
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Whoa... she just farted.
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
Very funny, Hawk.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
What the fuck!
Uh... dudes?
Here's a suggestion.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
I think we should try sneaking in.
I found the Volvo.
No... You don't think...?
Could be.
Are you gettin' wise with me?
Well, let's recap, shall we?
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Dude, this is all I got.
Jam, listen up.
Cool.
Don't worry about it.
Oh no, Jam.
It doesn't mean anything.
Hey, Look at the front entrance!
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip.
It was stolen!
I'm sorry, guys.
I got...
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Oh, hi, mom.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
Ahh, sunshine.
They're not idiots.
Mom, what're we...?
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
Well? Continue! Continue!
No.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
Poor, Jam, man.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Yeah, right.
That's some sick shit right there.
I knew it!
Hey, take it easy, man.
I did it!
Simplicity, Hawk.
About fuckin' time if you ask me.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass.
It's gone.
But we took the keys?
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Please sir, don't beat me up.
Hey, kid, that's okay.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass!
Two hundred bucks?
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Gimme your gun, boy!
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
Is that your final answer?
I did?
Good morning, mongrels!
Hi... what's going on here?
What was his name?
I feel bad for his family.
Dr. Monnitoff?
Like a DeLorean.
When can I squeeze one out?
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie?
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
Dea ex machina...
How can you do that?
Why did you make me flood the school?
I want to show you something.
What happened to your eye?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH!
How old is Grandma Death?
What'd you do, Donnie?
Hey...
Wanna walk me home?
Don't look so freaked.
So... you just moved here?
Wow. Did he go to jail?
I should go.
I mean, the whole sanitation thing.
You're weird.
Where are you going?
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward?
Donnie?
What happened to your neck?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark.
That's alright... I understand.
We're moving through time.
They suspended me for two days.
Oh, yeah.
I know she's here.
So, we call them... IMGs.
What? How long was I asleep?
Will you please talk to me?
Hey.
Did you call the cops?
What?
Come with me.
Time is running out.
Is that a cellar door?
People aren't that simple.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn?
You're such a fuck-ass.
I wish I knew where you went at night.
Grandma Death.
He can't, Samantha.
So how was school today?
Oh, shit!
Grandma Death.
You're right.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
You're my only son...
Who is Frank?
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
What's "Cellar Door"?
Cellar door.
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
So, I met a new friend.
How many times have you seen Frank?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
Nothing.
Whoa.
People get hurt.
Where are we going, Donald?
What is going to happen?
I can see him right now!
Your medication.
Whoa, Elizabeth.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
How much are they paying you to be here?
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
I... What can we do?
If that's what you think is necessary.
Our son just called me a bitch.
So let me get this straight.
What?
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
Excuse me?
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
No.
Here are the keys to the Taurus.
I got twelve classrooms full of water.
Christ. Is that an axe?
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
Kitty, I don't know what to say.
Rose.
And how do they do this?
Chut up!
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
What is this shit?
Wicked.
Is Mom okay?
Mommmm!
You're what?!
So, what do I say?
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
That was your mom.
Oh, Mom's okay.
What is wrong with you?
It's all the stuff I get to do.
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Loretta, don't do that.
I just, I just can't believe it.
Oh, Amber...
Amber? Here.
Shut up, yous guys.
Mrs. Leeman?
Sorry.
Amber...
I'm gonna need more caps.
...Yah -- 1963.
Oh shit!
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Go on! Get out!
Mom!
Ow!
Bye mom.
Okay, okay!
Uh, Amber?
I hate her!
What're you doin' here?

So, anyone talk to Janelle?
Hi...
Here, I'll take it.
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.

Don't fall for it.
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!
We was robbed.
Annette, just use your hand.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it.
I'm a mirror.
...Oh, yeah-right.
What a surprise.

Lester?
Hey!
Hey, Ted, sorry.
So help me, Gladys.
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Iris, stop!
Oh, there's a parking space over there.
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Oh! What is it?
Okay, I designed the float, you know.
Are we on "Cops?
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Let's get this straight right now.
Here I am, Father.
My dear President...  read it back...
Dear Sir.
Here I am, Father...
Father...
Who to?
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
In her dressing room?
What's the matter with you?
Hey you!!
Have you got a license?
That was for you.
My card.
Wait a minute.
Send in the next girl. 
You no gotta no gun.
Late again, eh?
How'm I doing, boss?
Chicolini, you've come just in time.
Are you sure you're not tired?
That's even a greater honor.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
This has gone far enough!
That's what you think.
Then it's war?
What'll I do with this card?
You've made a wonderful impression.
Oh, Rufus!
So -- you've come to ask for clemency!
Oh, won't you reconsider...
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
I shall report this indignity the my President.
So that's the one you want to marry.
Uncle, you can't do this!
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
Oh yes.
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
They have noble faces.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
You won't be long?
Did it go well, darling?
Freddie?
I'm sorry.
John loves the house.
Yes.
You stay with me.
More romances for John?
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
You sly bastard.
What are you going to do?
Don't!
What did you do to him?
What happened?
He's a clumsy git.
This man belongs in hospital.
I like doing business with you.
I want my man back.
Now I think we really do understand one another.
Good morning, Treves.
Don't be frightened.
It's only a physical problem.
Oh yes?
How did you, know the rest?
Treves. Well done.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
Don't we?
Has the response picked up?
Don't you think this is a bit premature?
How are you feeling today?
...everyone has been very kind.
What is it, Treves?
How long has this man been here?
Abominable things these machines.
I say Freddie, what are you about?
Good Lord, Freddie!
You never mentioned his mental state.
Good day...!
She's very pretty, your mother.
Mr.
Have you read it?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
It's all arranged.
You alright?
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Thank you very much.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
What?
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
What's this?
I'll have to find some more.
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
...Yyes
Mr.
...Yes potatoes... but...
Good evening. How are you feeling?
This... is my new home?
How long will I stay here?
You look splendid, John.
John... what's the matter?
Well, it's a lovely bedroom.
The Children. Where are your children
Good morning, John.
No John, I can't.
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
How blind of me.
You want a dressing bag, John?
...my... home?
My home.
Is it the one you wanted?
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Yes John?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
The workhouse.
Good morning, Mr.
Won't come out, eh?
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Watery headed bunch.
Incredible, isn't it?
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
Don't lie to me.
Are you the proprietor?
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing.
Open up! I know you're in there!
Right! Where is he?
Well... where is he?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
It's all right! It isn't happening!
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
WHAT did you say?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
Please! Please! What are those?
What's the matter?
WHY?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
The Cloak Invisible.
We mustn't let him land!
Just give me a hand.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
No!
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
No!
No.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
The second note.
Erik!
Blow the third note!
Then I shall come too.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
But --
But... How is it you can see me?
How do we know this is the way?
What do you see, Erik?
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
Is there nothing men can do?
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
No... we don't...
How?
Would you like us to sing to you?
No. 
We're just not a very musical nation...
No.
Your Majesty!
I'll tell you what...
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
It's all part of our safety regulations.
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
Is there something the matter with it?
But it IS! Look!
Have you done this sort of thing before?
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
Scream.
You told them I raped you -- why?
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Is THAT Odin?
Why should you care?
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
"But" what?
What are you talking about?
It's Halfdan the Black!
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
How deep IS the ocean?
Let's hack her to pieces.
What's wrong with making friends?
That's terrible!
Halfdan the Black's here!
But.
It's not magic!
We're missing all the fun...
I... I... KILLED her...
He can have my place.
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Slower! In... Out...
Faster!
What are YOU doing here?
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
SHUT UP!
Look, the sky is blue...
It's magic.
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
What did he say?
You must help us.
Erik the Viking!
You mean we'd be dead?
Thank you VERY much indeed.
That's better.
Row!
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
Listen!
A magic dishcloth.
Weren't we supposed to?
No! Let go, Snorri!
There is another way.
You need to say a bit more than that!
What's the matter with them?
I think we should go...
Wait, Erik!
Bjorn's not.
What do you think?
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
Well, what else do we do?
Don't you see, Erik!
What are you talking about, Erik?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
But HOW?
Hey, you two! What's going on?
Look, I bagged it last week.
I AM one, Dad!
ROW!
She hasn't got any.
Hy-Brasil?
Sven!
I came to find my grandfather.
Bye, Leif.
What's all the panic about?
It can't do you any HARM...
How did he do that?
You coming?
You know, my son, our lord said...
Are you all right?
I know. I know.
He used to puke in his sleep.
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Aaagh!
Let me go, Sven.
Well! Come on!
Who's that?
What?
Ooh, that's a good one!
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
Sh! Hurry!
I can't swim! I can't swim!
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
Help!
Shut up!
You've lost your mind.
I should have got rid of you long ago!
Made by YOU, Loki!
It's a tradition.
We're being attacked!
KILL! KILL!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
Well, of course he is!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well, go on! Go berserk!
There is nothing we can do...
He drove me mad!
He's not in Valhalla!
Well I'M certainly not, either.
Well... I'm game.
Shut up.
Thorfinn! You can't die!
And you've got BOTH axes?
I don't know, honey.
You weren't supposed to see that.
Thanks, guys.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it.
I remember you turned around.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
Shit. The last time I saw you.
No, it was lovely.
May I help you?
Ms. Kruczynski?
How are you today?
I just thought I'd say hi.
Come over after I'm done here?
It's so cool.
Oh, baby, what's going on?
Come up to Boston with me?
I'm so excited. Yay!
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
What's wrong with me?
How are you today?
Maybe gay isn't the right word.
I'm sorry.
Really?
It's okay if I sit closer?
My name's Clementine, by the way.
I don't need nice.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
Hi.
Where do you live?
So you like bookstores, huh?
Thanks very much.
Take care.
You like that?
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
God, that feels so fucking good.
Ready for another?
What do you want to hear?
Well, I should probably get going.
Thanks.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
You're really nice.
Well, for the last week, anyway!
I would like you to call me.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
How could she have done this to me?
Yo ho ho!
I can't believe you wrecked my car.
A wino?
Let me drive you home.
How can you watch this crap?
Oh shit.
What?!
Oh, thank God. It's going.
So, um --
You're drunk.
You don't tell me things, Joel.
More?
Joely...
Such a beautiful view.
What if you hide me?
I want my mommy.
You know, we're okay.
You remember what happened next?
There's this guy!
They found us before.
Look at you, cutey!
Joel!
Happy Birthday.
I scoured the city for it.
I'm done, Clem.
Right. Something black though.
I thought I was foolish.
I dropped you off after. You said --
I told her today I need to end it.
Joel, I'm not a concept.
Hi there.
You said...
You know what I did.
I'm Clementine.
Oh God, how horrid.
This is it, Joel.
No, I stopped.
I wish we did. You married?
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Male or female?
Cool.
C'mon, man.
I knew.
Ah-ha!
So go.
Bye, Joel.
So you'll call me, right?
Don't worry.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
I think I should go back.
Listen, did you want to make love?
You're still excited by my irreverence.
What took you so long?
Yeah?
It's true.
Look, I have to go.
Hi, it's Joel.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
That's me.
It was snowing.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
I might be making a mistake.
Pink.
It's them.
I should maybe talk to you.
Clementine.
Gotta get home.
So then she just stops calling.
Right!
How's the chicken?
She's so sexy.
I can't.
Naomi.
Okay. I wish you could come.
Your back to me.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
Clementine.
I really should go.
We can help you through this.
Yours?
Naomi, I really value our relationship.
So what's going on, Joel?
Hi.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
So you don't mind?
Say hi to Rob and Carrie.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
I love quotes.
Definitely!
Boo.
Stan... c'mon...
See you later, alligator.
It's freezing out.
Nietzsche.
Yup.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
It's amazing, isn't it?
It's stopped.
It's not erasing.
I don't know what to do!
No way. I can handle this.
He's coming?
Hey.
It was here.
And after that?
I really like you, Mary.
Oh.
What's this?
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
Howard, your one o'clock.
Mary...
Okay, we're back in.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
There's another one I like, I read.
That's lovely.
I've loved you for a very long time.
We can't do this.
What, Howard?
Thanks.
Stan? What's going on?
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
Mary. What are you doing here?
I tried that already.
You get some sleep, Howard.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
I'll go out for a smoke.
She should not have done this, Stan.
Oh, hi.
The voltage looks fine.
Does that help?
It's an apartment.
Yeah?
I gotta tell you something.
Mary hates me.
What's your bartlett's?
Hold on.
I can handle it.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
But I don't know how to polka.
What was that?
What do you believe in then?
Is everything getting worse?
I want to go back to the Clock People.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
A traveler, eh?
Where are the others?
Welcome, podner.
Tell me about it.
You're political, then?
That's Jellybean!
No, I guess not.
Extraordinary!
How does she like what in bed?
What do you think?
I'm cold.
What are you doing?
Going north?
Thanks.
Are you in show business?
To my own special Sissy.
Sissy, don't play dumb with me!
Ballast.
That means top-secret, Cooper.
I can see why they sent you along.
You still need the rope?
...do you copy?
Holy shit...
Time to play Spam in the can.
Okay, listen up.
From what?
We have a man down...
But Justin...
You been out there a long time.
It's holding... She's holding...!
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
I don't know what happened to Justin.
Is that an offer?
What's happening?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
How? The Bridge is gone.
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
What...?
He's a rescue technician.
We haven't tested the air yet.
How is he?
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
Of course not.
What is it?
Do you hear it? Right there.
DJ.
Please...
What's wrong?
What's happening...?
What's wrong?
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
It's not that simple.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
I want our best people on this.
What, Justin, what shows you?
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
...is zero.
You've reached the First Containment Seal.
I've reached another containment door.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
Okay.
Justin, finish your sweep.
Patch me through to him.
...I don't want to die...!
This is Weir.
What's the hold up?
We've got pressure.
Jesus its huge.
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Peters is right, no one's here.
I can see the hatch.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Everything's been shut down.
I found one.
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks.
Can anybody hear me...
That's a negative, Starck.
Peters.
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
What does it say?
That's the engineering containment.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
You're in the central corridor.
I can see that, what're they for?
Any survivors?
No one?
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
Yes.
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?
It's insane.
I want this room sealed.
You have something, Dr. Weir?
Explanation?
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
Is that your "expert opinion?
I want to know what caused that noise.
We're leaving.
What about my ship?
You can't leave.
Your eyes...
Weir is dead.
What are you?
There is no Devil.
You can't have them. Go to hell.
Jesus...
Heading three-three-four...
We're all on edge, Smith.
I guess we're about to find out.
We've got some weather.
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
Proximity warning!
Put it through TACS.
It is now.  We're locked in.
Captain Miller...
Do we have enough time for a weld?
But...
Captain Miller, you copy?
Sir.
Thank you.
Skipper...
Smith, get out of there...
Where is it, where is it...
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
Crossing the horizon.
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
That's an affirmative.
Everybody okay?
It tastes bad.
What's the point?
Maybe one of the original crew?
Miller...
Go ahead.
You've got to listen...
Miller, come in...
What?
I'm on my way, Starck.
Weir can't be alive.
Weir activated the drive.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
I'll do it --
We're armed.
Weir.
First time in a grav couch?
Don't worry about it.
Claire...
Here's another one.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist.
No. I saw nothing.
About an hour ago.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
He's engaged the override.
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Almost got it.
We have to do something, oh God...
You got any coffee?
Hey...
Where is she?
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
Foredecks.
What the hell is that?
The safety circuit's failed!
What?
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
You can't do that.
If they are, they're screening their calls.
Range 500 meters and holding.
What happened to his eyes?
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
What if the air has gone bad?
Relativity, yes.
A straight line.
The reactor's still hot.
Could it be the crew?
What is it?
What is it?
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
What are you doing?
What is it?
How'd you know it was me?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Those yours too?
Way to not overthink it.
I can handle the ship.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben.
You look like an eighties rock band.
He didn't.
He didn't mean it.
Where is Reed?
What are you doing here?
Ben, come in.
What do you want, Vic?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
I'll be watching over you.
Deb.
Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
I can't take this.
What about his first born?
He knew about NASA.
Can't do it.
They crashed it into a wall.
Isn't that your speech?
The shields on the station should protect us.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
How long was I out?
I don't know.
What?
Are you alright?
What the --!
We had a tough year.
You got a chisel round here?
Okay.
It's about to be a broken face.
Ben --
Time for your lesson, Vic.
What the hell you smiling at?
Where... where am I?
What's wrong with me?
Hey! That's a prototype!
The machine works.
No more cracks about how I look.
What?
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
And where do we think we're going?
You're hot!
Me like-y.
You're on fire!
Victor's right.
He's not responsive --
Now what is up with that?
Oh, you dawg you.
This is wrong in so many ways.
Twenty?
Back it down, Johnny!
Is there something about flames?
He's right.
That's what I'm trying to calculate.
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Apparently I can disappear.
Flame on, flame off.
Stop it.
What is that thing?
Wait.
You're really cramping my style here.
I'm driving.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.
You two need a time-out.
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Johnny, slow down.
What are you doing --
They're ready for you, sir.
Our numbers are through the roof.
Leonard, how's the feed?
How's the IPO?
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue?
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.
Feeling better?
You're happy for me and Victor.
For science.
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
It has to be the cloud.
What?
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
It's not "invisibility" per se.
Reed.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
What are you doing?
But we're the focus, right Reed?
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Remember our first date here...?
I can... make it work.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Got it.
Come on, Ben, come on...
Not until Ben is back inside!
Just a little banged up.
Didn't go as planned?
What are you doing here?
But I'm not done with the machine --
It's just business.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, your scar --
You said it was urgent.
Victor, wait, slow down a second.
He's working round the clock.
Please don't make this personal --
'Scuse me.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
What's there to do at the Point?
Something happened to them, mon.
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
I can't find it, mon!
Easy, mon.
Hamilton, come over here.
Come on, Hamilton.
I can't do that.
Hi, Brad.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Is everything okay at work?
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Are you still a virgin?
Does Mom know you have company?
Yeah.
Any problems?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Come on.
Dad says you have to get up!
Leave me alone!
Jeff you have company!
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Hey!
You know Mark Ratner really likes you.
Do you have any ice tea?
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon.
Do you want to take a quick swim?
Pick a suit.
Are you really a virgin?
Listen.
You're a really good kisser.
Hey, Mike?
What's wrong?
Oh. Hi.
What's going on?
Why don't you call me up tonight?
How do you know it's mine?
Take that back.
There's only one thing we can do.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
You.
All right... where did you see her?
Don't talk to her.
The business is changing, Rat.
Hey, Rat.
Knock it off, Damone.
Okay.
Yo.
Damone, are you there?
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Well, I've gotta be running.
Poor guy.
No.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive.
You're losing it, Damone.
Are you Linda Barrett?
How've you been?
Seriously, Merv, everything is great.
I hear you brought a film clip with you.
Who's that?
Are you going to ride that wave?
Hey, slow down.
Seen the new Playboy?
What the fuck is this guy doing?
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
My brother's car!
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
My brother is going to kill us.
That's him! He did it!
How's it going.
Don't you like him?
He gave me his card.
Face it.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
Yeah but they look more sophisticated.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
Was it great?
There.
You've got to get used to working Christmas.
Don't you think it meant anything to him.
I should quit this job.
I sent a letter to Doug today.
How long does Doug take?
What do you think?
I didn't ask for any help.
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
Stacy!
God, Stacy, it's not that sad.
What do you think it is?
I really thought he would show up.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Where's Doug?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
Can I come in?
Mr. Spicoli?
You just ripped my card in two!
Hey!
Am I hallucinating here?
You better save some for me, you swine!
Mr... Mr. Hand.
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
Don't worry, Spicoli.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
What can I get for you tonight.
Thanks for picking me up.
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.
That's a nice shirt.
It's very warm out tonight.
Are you really nineteen?
I think I better take you home.
Is this your first time?
What's your other question?
Do you have a pen?
Thanks for coming to get me.
This is a nice car.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Do you know what you want?
Are you all right?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
I had a really nice time tonight.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis.
Where's your brother?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
I don't know.
This is me in the eighth grade.
...I've got to go home.
Where's Mike today?
I made a fool of myself.
Hi, Mark.
Yeah?
Really?
Are you ready to order here?
Sir?
I checked the register for this man Thompson.
But he will be available?
Let's have lunch!
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Mr. Duke?
Rum and ice, please.
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
Naked!?
Cut their goddamn heads off.
Hell, no.
I'm a whiskey man myself.
What happened? What did they do to her?
Yeh.
Hell, I really hate to hear this.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
Oh, my God!...
Thanks for the ride.
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus.
We're your friends.
God hell!
I tell you, my man.
O.
...and we're chock full of that!
Where's the medicine?
Turn up the fucking music!
Savage Henry has cashed his check!
Oh, Jesus!
How long do I have?
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda.
That's the press table.
Shoot it.
What are you talking about?
That's good...
Total control now.
Why?
Holy shit!
Jesus creeping shit!
This is the place.
When does this thing stop?
Did you see that?
Don't run.
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
That dirty bastard!
Where'd you get that knife?
Have you made a deal with him?
You evil son of a bitch.
I want that fucking radio!
Not me.
Fuck yes.
You bastard!
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
You degenerate pig!
WELL? What are your plans?
Jesus Christ.
NO!
Read the newspapers.
What could they do?
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
What's wrong with you?
Sure.
Good work.
OK, goddamnit!
What is this?
Adrenochrome...
Why not?
So do we, lady.
Fuck the car.
What are you doing?
The airport is over there!
No!
Don't take any guff from those swine.
Please.
What made you do it?
The dope ring.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
You'd pay me for that?
May I see your license.
Could I have that, please?
You realize...
Okay.
You're lying!
In that case, maybe she can help.
What?
Oh Lord!
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
Stop!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
You can't keep me here.
Careful.
I will not die because of him!
We should go! We should go right now!
Are you two all right?
You know where it is?
We'll meet in three hours?
Where are you two going?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
IS IT CLEAR?!
My god damn foot is gone!
Well, it don't look pretty.
I got my .
I don't think you should...
Stop it.
We shot a skunk.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
I think I know where a CB is.
Okay, now.
Oh!
Wha?
You got something better?
We'll be food, dickheads!
And that's how I ended up here.
So, your husband ditched you?
They're right here.
Don't bullshit me!
What tunnel? Where?
HEY!
You all sure about this?
Where's the tunnel?
We just smeared a skunk.
You seem mighty collected about this.
You're trusting that guy?
Scared?
Ohhh.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
Do you drive a short beer bus or something?
We're better off.
Come on!
What now, Geronimo?
Why do you take shit from him?
I'm in.
We're going to get help.
We gotta be close.
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
Yeah, the lot's right there.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
How are you holding up?
Push and twist, it's child proof.
What is this?
Doesn't your foot hurt?
Um-hmmm.
You wanna see, baby?
How much you got to see the show?
What? Really?
My husband...
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
Will these boards hold?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
Go for it.
What?
What's it for!?
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
I wouldn't do that, son.
I'll go with ya.
Welcome back.
They were all over the place.
Bullshit.
Clever fuckers.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
Got 'cha!
'Eh, Chief?
Fine, Chief.
What?!
Move it!
Shit!
JUST A BAT!
Hurry!
SHIT.
COME ON!
Yeah, maybe.
HELP MEEE!
Nothin' will happen to you.
OH JESUS!
Well, maybe they migrate?
Hey!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Yeah, I'll go.
Let's move.
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with?
What's wrong?
Let's go.
DON'T!
Let's wait it out.
Okay, well that's something.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Hold it!
Let's go!
Go! Go!
Get to your cars!
Oh my God... What is that?
Cody!
Oh sweetheart!
Shut up!
You know you don't have to do this.
Her name is Charlie.
We should stick together out there.
Did we make it?
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Well... come on.
Frances?  Oh no.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
I like your looks.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Well, I suppose I should just say it.
That's not all, Frances.
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
Good, good. Give them that.
Madam...?
Oh my God!
Okay, but come here first.
The Group is more than a theatre company.
Hello, Harold.
What's up?
You don't think I'm good enough?
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
Get your clothes on.
You learn your lines?
There was another call too.
Oh, God!
Let's get out of here!
Harry!
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
No.
Harry?
Were you an alcoholic?
Thank you, Ralph.
Bye, baby.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
Dad, please, don't leave early.
What do I do, Dad?
I love you, Mama.
...So what do you think?
Francie, you know I can't do that.
Dad, here!
You know where you're taking me.
Are you... are you hungry?
Bread?
You're poisoning that child's mind.
I'm going back to the hotel.
Kurt!
Name?
Age?
I'm really sad it's closing.
Aren't you ever going back?
What?
Is it true you're getting a divorce?
Just one minute...
Okay then...
I'll.
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
Honest.
You know, my old man was an inventor.
Frances...
How ya doin', Farmer?
Not bad.
Jesus.
Not bad.
Serious, huh?
Shit. I meant the other way around.
Frances, you're a movie star now.
Tell you what.
Don't start, Farmer.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
Two lines!
How the hell do you find me anyway?
Nice joint. Can you afford it?
Six months' probation...?
Take a walk, pal.
Oh my God, I look awful.
Evening, gorgeous.
Where are we, mean man?
Harry, I have to go home.
You know something, Harry?
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
There's just one more thing.
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances! Frances!
I love you, Harry. I love you.
Where to?
This is it, kid.
Been a lot of years, you know.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
I got a new car.
It's going to be slow from now on.
Goodbye, Harry.
Pretty morning.
Where you goin'?
Yeah.
Shit!
...Is that not true?
Miss Farmer!
What happened? Who're you?
That's me, Clifford.
I'm not!
'But how do I know you love me?'
How's it sound?
Mama...
Don't listen to him, little sister.
But they're using you!
I'll pay your way to New York.
It isn't in your hands, Mama.
It's okay.
Tell them who I am!
And here's one from nice Mr.
Well, who have we here...?
I think I need a little air.
How long will you be?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Say you promise.
I'm back, Mama.
Don't... talk crazy.
Haven't you heard what I said?
Where are you going?
Oh, just leave those things for now.
No!
Oh! Are you really?
Is there something else?
Not at all.
I'm sorry.
I want outta here, you understand?
Symington says...
I don't know why they even bother.
You were with him at the end.
I longed to be with him.
I've never been shown a kindness.
Nice.
I'm glad you finally came to the door.
You're an outcast.
I have been.
Come warm yourself if you like.
The letters in your journal.
Why, Victor?
In which part of me did this knowledge reside?
What can I do?
Soon?
Why... her?
What is this?
You will honor your promise to me!
She's beautiful.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
Poor William! What indignant tears!
That's the nature of all progress, William.
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
You dance so beautifully together.
Must've been a terrible row.
Nothing. Still nothing.
Are you all right?
He always was opinionated.
What does it say?
Have you seen Willie?
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
What kind of God is He to will this?
Victor, have a care!
Oh, do give him here!
Don't listen, Willie.
Smell the air. Wonderful.
I've loved you all my life
This feels... incestuous.
Brother and sister still?
You make me weak.
Our decision. Together.
My mind was not playing tricks.
Do you know this man?
I thought I'd never see you again!
What sort of task?
No.
Brother and sister no more.
I remember the first time I ever saw you.
Victor!
It's going to ram us.
Captain, I implore you.
A warming wind.
I'm quite serious.
Professor?
I was just clearing my throat.
I am not mad.
Are you having me on?
Henry Clerval.
Do you really think I'm mad?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
The entire school heard it.
Now you've got him started.
Only you would think of that!
And here's to Him.
They just caught the man who did it.
Keep your voice down.
You're making a scene!
Victor.
This is a bad time, Henry.
Thank God your fever broke.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most.
Quite a place.
What happened up there?
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Yes.
I have always loved him.
Paracelsus?
Professor Waldman.
Preposterous.
Electricity.
Re-configure the leads?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
I tell you what we need, my friends.
You're awake.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Do you share my madness?
We are kindred, you and I.
It's just this place.
So young, so pretty.
The killer is still out there.
We should go now.
What'd you see?
Shows how much you know.
Melvin Belli.
I think we should go wake them up.
Good night, Alice.
Cabin B is ready.
That's got her.
You draw very well.
Any particular reason?
Next Friday.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
Alice? The others show up?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
Oh, my God...
How come you're leaving?
And it's this place.
Filmmaker.
It still hurts?
What'll you do when you leave here?
You can only do what you can do.
How the... did he get in there?
Trouble?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Help you clean up?
I don't hear it anymore.
Where?
I'll go check on Brenda.
Jack?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
What's the matter with it?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
How come?
I'll be along.
I'm sorry.
Sure.
You said we were special.
You know what I said, though.
I wouldn't know.
Claudette...
Somebody's there, Barry.
What the hell?
Give me a hand?
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
You saved my life.
Floor probably leaks.
What is it?
Roll him over!
Chance to get even?
You just had some lucky shots.
Holy shit...
No wonder they lost America.
What hath God wrought?
Ha!
Ow!
Jack?
It's gonna be a long summer.
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator.
How about our last jay?
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
Wind's up.
What about Neddy?
Looks like a storm.
It's just a dream.
This is no dream.
Are you wet?
Mmmmmmmph?
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
It's beautiful...
Cowboy.
Doctor.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
You okay?
Anything else you want?
I have six new counsellor up there.
Yeah.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
Good luck.
How many with you?
What was that?
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
I'm sorry to hear that.
You like the car?
Why do you want to stop?
What's this guy's problem?
What are you gonna do?
Have you forgotten about your sister?
Now, you listen to me.
You don't believe in suicide.
Why did they block the door again?
What's your name?
What's the story with you two?
It's okay, honey.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
Not a chance.
Yes.
Jacob Fuller.
Who's this?
Is this real?
If he touches her, I'll kill him.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico.
Then?
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Who else?
Why are you so agitated?
What did you call me?
To your family.
Now, is your shit together?
You too, preacher?
I don't know about that.
Did he...?
You all are gonna fuckin' die!
What's this stuff?
I promise.
It's the bitterest of pills.
I just bet you would.
There's nothing wrong with this place.
It has a bed.
About two hours from now.
I promise.
I'm going for 'em!
What's going on?
What?
What?
Creepy guy.
You got three minutes.
Yeah.
You're gonna let us go?
How about you, cutie pie?
Are you okay?
We have to go back for Daddy!
Watch my back!
How many bullets left, kid?
Should I use the last bullets on us?
I'm sorry.
See ya.
Why, just look at all this.
Hot goddamn day!
What do you want from me?
Were you giving that pig signals?
He says you were scratching.
I never said help us!
Whiskey!
Best in Mexico.
What the fuck was that about?
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Start the car.
Richie? You okay?
Yeah?
What did I tell you?
Do they have cable?
How's it feel?
Shit, I started to get worried.
Yeah, I saw the border.
Where's the woman?
What'd ya mean, what?
Yeah, explain it to me.
Is this my fault?
Richard!
This isn't gonna work.
They're gonna search the van.
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
This ain't the time, Richard.
I'm curious.
You okay?
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
That's what you think?
How?
Earth to Richie.
How are you?
How 'bout you?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar.
You could take their head off.
He's right, Kate.
B.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Got it.
Wow...

Yes?
Hardly the case, Senator.
"The Lark Report."
"Coronado."
Can't complain, ma'am.
Jordan.
You know him.
Wickwire was there to help.
So?

Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
Just do it, okay?
O'Neil?
Time.
Miller.
Thank you, sir.
The Navy Cross...
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Do we know it's him using the beacon?
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
So why're you even considering it?
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
Jordan...
I've been trying you for five days.
That bad?
Well, not this.
So why are you telling me this?
All I wanted was an honest chance.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
"In Washington..."
So here we are again.
They're more afraid of you.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
Who is it?
You really came back for more?  Of this?
O'Neil?
Sorry, didn't mean to --
Do you, uh, know...
I'm sorry, O'Neil.
What're you guys doing?  Huh?

Permission to get dressed, sir?
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.
England went out with a stress fracture.
Simple question, lieutenant.
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
Would you have shot if it was a man?
Do you?
Managed to activate the ELB.
Got it.
O'Neil...
Well, who the shit you think you are?
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
Clear.
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers.
I just wonder how that happened.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
We're fucked.
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
This ain't workin' right!
Subject?
All right.
The White House.
That's cuz I'm married to you.

Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
He stole my report! That's my report!
You okay?
My God. He's going after the nest.
Animal, I can't.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Don't you think we have enough?

He's not going to do it.
What are you talking about?
I'll take them all.
Audrey?
So you made it.
You're a reporter.
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
Wait.
I still can't believe it.
...he's pregnant.
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually.
Is this cause of me?
What are you doing here?
Circuits are overloaded.
The network is on an intranet.
Are you okay?
Who was that French guy, anyway.
My life sucks.
It's Nick!
Did Romeo have a name?
Four years.
What the hell are you doing?
Wish me luck!

Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl?
Not for a long time, now.
Hence the radiation.
Evacuate Manhattan?
I'm sorry about all this.
Merde!
We've secured the doors on both levels.
Who are they?
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance.
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
You didn't answer my question.
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
What sample?
That was a footprint.
Somebody must have seen it.
Well, yes.
No, it reproduces asexually.
You gave them the tape?
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain.
Organize a search party.
Are you looking for this?
Do I know you?
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage.
So why all the secrecy?
I am a patriot.
Here.
What's with the chewing gum?
They've turned off the ventilation system.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
I think we should leave now.
What'd they say?
Who the hell are you?

This is it?
Just as on your home planet, sir.
Dr.
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!

Can it be repaired?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Self control?
You're playing your good side.
How does the rolling help, actually?
Clenched jaw...

Where the hell is he?
You're kidding. When for?
Unbelievable.
You gotta admit, they do love him.

Hold course, Laredo!
Continue forward, sir?
Find them.

WHAT? WH
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.
We've got to attack the British!
What's your frank estimation of the British?
Arnold!
Damn-it!
Go on... I want to hear everything.
The army needs you.
Well, George, who were you?
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
They're ready.
Have you heard?
They love Reed and his inquisition!
Misunderstood what!?
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Wil...
Well, what have you thought?
No uniforms.
Negroes?
General Lee, welcome back.
Who is that!?
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
How old are you, Captain?
I'm so inclined.
They're among the best divisions the British have.
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
What are we going to do?
General Greene is here.
Yessir.
Sir, I think no such thing.
What is this?
This is a declaration of insurrection!
What's your advice, Alexander?
That's why the people trust you George.
Horatio!
With your support, Horatio.
Colonel Charles Lee.
George, I'm sorry.
Washington is perfect.
Let's not over do it...
You think that?
Partially...
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
Any word from Canada?
My God.
Colonel Reed...
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?
A grand scheme?
What do you mean you're not a Christian?
But the Hessians are there!
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.
No, please; an advance on your salary.
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.
Like flowers after the snow melts.
What is it, Marquis?
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
I feel the same, sir.
It's another demonstration against the king.
That's right...
Martha... what?
Not today.
We can't take them.
Colonel Washington?
But, you do come from a military family?
A horseshoer?
I certainly didn't mean you.
General Greene?
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.
What the hell are we doing?
Well, this must be about something!
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?
Think what the play means, William.
Where... do those men come from, George?
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
Then why are you teaching me...?
Do you?
I don't laugh at you, George.
What are you doing?
You are a slave owner!
All people have rights!
You hear that?
The land here is best for grain and corn.
My daughter, I ask only...
What is this?
And I mean high up in it.
He knew it was a set up.
You see the paper?
He's gonna plea-deal his way out.
You get the money?
Trade for what?
You get life for kidnapping.
Hell, why not just shoot her?
And that's for the airport.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
Where is my nephew?
He's my sister's kid.
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
What's this movie you're doing first?
Title's the first thing's got to go.
There's Ilona.
You know how to write one of these?
I need the money.
Karen? You okay?
That's a nice scream, lady.
You know Laurel Canyon?
Where's Karen?
She's great. Gimme the money.
Bo.

He was watching Letterman, huh?
I don't know.
C-18.
Okay.
Ray Barboni?
Hello? You there?
Where's Leo Devoe?
What?
How'd you get in here?
Why would I do that?
Who the fuck are you?
You a quick draw... 'bro?
You live in Miami?
Your wife a Lakers fan?
Hey, Chil?
Have we met? I don't recall.
I'm looking at you.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
A marker's like a check, Harry.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
You make movies, huh?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer.
You want to hear this idea?
Without him.
Keep going.
So he comes to L.A...
That's it? That's your movie?
Part of it, yeah.
You pack a gun?
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
She looks familiar.
You don't say any more'n you have to.
What?
Here's your keys, Harry.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong.
Really.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
You got a miss.
Yeah, he told me.
Yeah. That was a good party.
Well, you had it down cold.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
How about this?
The wife sues the airline.
Very nice...
Whatta you think, Chill?
You've been losing.
But you won't know where I am.
It's not one of these?
We call you a taxi.
The door from the patio, in back.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
You saw that one?
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
You been here the whole time?
I got you a copy of the script.
I think it's not horrible.
I was never much into it.
This thing's actually accurate.
A locker at the airport?
That was Martin.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
So what about your story.
Yeah?
I think you could be an actor.
You don't mean a movie star?
Harry... My God...
Why not?
Harry, what're you doing?
You sure?
You okay?
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
Were you scared up there?
I'll be right back.
What took you so long?
They're closing the Granview.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
Hey, Chili.
I told you not to -
Yeah, but whose point of view?
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Hello, Doris.
What a spectacular view.
I miss Murray, Harry.
What's wrong?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
How did you get in the house?
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
Harry -
Which two?
I have to run.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Oh, for Christ's sake -
Lufkin. His... agent.
Hi, sweetface.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior.

The turbine blew.
Where from?

You think that's funny
Ready?
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
This's gonna hurt a little.
What other choices have we got?
Guess I'll just keep working.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Maybe that is his boat.
Fifty million dollars.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps.
Smokes?
I'm no doctor.
Try Wednesday.
Did you?
What say, Epps?
Dodge.  Dodge.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
It's a bloody navigation hazard.
Mother fucker!
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed.
What's this?
Obviously it's some kind of screw up.
Went aboard.
It's a hell of a lot of money.
Or somebody stopped them.
So what're we gonna do.
You gotta be kidding?
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger.
Sounds like the hull.
I say fuck the motherfucker.
Bodies're too fresh.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
That'd be my guess.
Can't you use something else?
Dodge to Murphy.
It was a man's voice.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
So.
The radio!
Take it easy, willya?
I didn't touch the fucking radio!
Yeah.
What the hell happened!
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight.
You're late.
What's slow?
Morning everybody.
Could be a fishing boat.
You mean, before she sank.
Then why didn't they take it.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
That's a good thing?
What'd he look like?
Coffee.
Stay away. Or else.
Any dizziness?
You okay?
I can't believe you.
Candy?
Go on.
The law's on our side.
Coffee?
What'd you find up there?
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
Maybe they didn't want it back.
Why not call for help?
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
Guess that'd be me. Again.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Got your light?
Murphy to Epps.
He needs a doctor.
How's he doing?
They're dead in the water that morning.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
The ah... the radio's out.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision.
It's not gonna hold us.
Hey.
What do you think happened on this boat?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool.
What, like some kind of ghost?
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word.
She said the ship was evil.
Why you?
Murphy to Epps.
Nope.
Epps? You there?
What do we do with him?
What do you think?
They went crazy.
What happened?
You killed them.
Greer to Murphy.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
Yeah.
Too deep to anchor out there.
Call the Coastguard?
It's funny.
Murphy, goddamit.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
Morning.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
So what?
I heard that.
What now?
Fifty million four ways.
Greer?
I don't know.
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Pretty low all around.
Ho-ly shit.
Greek citizen.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
How're you feeling?
What happened?
Oh, man.
It's a Noaa buoy.
We're still drifting.
He took the shotgun and a light.
Can't find the shotgun.
What about the gold?
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
I thought you say Tuesday.
You're kidding, right?
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Will you get off my back for once?
Hi.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
What's wrong with you?
Seymour?
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
And what can you tell us about this... 
Who is this, Enid?
Hmm.
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
What are you doing?
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
So Josh...
That guy rules!
Why do you even need a ride?
Aren't there a million places like this?
Yeah, right.
Jesus, look at this guy.
Forget it.
Hi Josh.
Hi... what's up?
Are you the one who left that note?
Do you want something to drink?
Oh, hi...
Hi Enid.
God, what a bunch of retards...
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Since when is she an "actress"?
Oh my god, look!
Hi.
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Much later.
"Authentic 50's diner"?
Hi, Al!
I might actually get the pasta special.
Jesus!
Does Oomie really like this show?
So what should we do?
Hey - why do you have this?
Look at how cute I am!
Look, that's back when I hated you.
I want to do him!
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
You call.
Look, maybe that's him!
I want to "make love" to him.
SHUT UP!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
It's obviously him!
What's going on now?
What's he doing now?
Do you think he knows?
Are you sure?
He's insane!
This is way too creepy.
What should we do?
Ew, look at this...
That was truly pathetic.
"Funky"?
What? How long have you been standing there?
We still have to go in there sometime.
Where are we going?
There he is...
JOSH!
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Why are we going here?
What was that all about?
How about this one?
Ew ... when did you get that?
How about this?
I totally, totally hate you.
Give me all your money, bitch!
That guy is totally amazing.
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
You're just jealous.
Are you kidding?
What are you talking about?
This is it?
What was that all about?
Now are you going to get a regular job?
Do you want to do something tonight?
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
Look, we have to get these...
Hello?
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?
You're the psycho!
Hello?
I'm sorry about the other day.
So, whaddya think?
There.
Hi.
Do you want anything?
Wow... finally.
What about me? Am I not even here?
We're not.
Oh my God, you guys!
May I ask what you're doing?
A what?
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.
Do you have any other old records besides these?
You still interested in that?
Didn't they tell you?
Oh, how "punk."
Go die, asshole!
Hi... what's your name?
That's five hundred dollars.
Do you have any old Indian records?
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
Is this one any good?
How much is it?
Oops! I dropped it!
Wow!
No you're not!
What about her?
Okay, what about this one?
So is that your boyfriend?
Yeah, sure... very funny....
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
Relax, Seymour, relax...
So, why did you bring this along?
What are we, in slow motion here?
Yes, that would certainly do...
What did you tell that girl?
Wow, this is so cool...
What the fuck, Seymour?
You can open your eyes now.
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
What is that?
Aren't you going to get that?
Wow!  What was that all about?
Uh... hello?
Boo!
Where have you been?
What are you doing here?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
Where did you get this?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
I really want to talk to you.
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Please Josh?
I agree.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
What do we have here, Margaret?
Uh.
Thank you, doctor.
Seymour?
You were contracted to work-
Morning, friend, glorious day.
No hints, Samuel.
I am a man of peace.
Starting now, we attack them.
John Henry Patterson, come in.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river.
Pleasant journey?
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Truthfully?
I do need to see Starling.
This is supposed to be salvation?
Are you running a high fever, man?
What?
Understand, I had help-
This sham?
You're certain about tomorrow?
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital.
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
That's a terrible idea-
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
Very good indeed.
Not once?
Many thanks.
Don't much like them.
Anything special about them?
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
Finish your tour?
I don't suppose I could watch.
John?
...one shot...
How lucky we are.
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
Second death? Where?-
What a good week.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
I don't really.
Have you got it?
...misfire... it jammed...
Think about something else.
Goddammit!
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John.
Their den?
Where could it have gone?
How many do you think they've killed?
Why do the workers look unhappy?
Did it look like this in your mind?
I am also liaison between these two.
What are they looking at?
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area.
Oh yes, I think so. 
For you.
Soon. 
You like him, don't you?
Thank you.
Three years I've worked for the railroad.
He has children?
Where is it?
Afraid of lions.
Why do you laugh?
How many cattle?
Why so many?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Where do you go next?
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.
Janosz?
Do you need anything?
What do you want with my baby?
Time is running out, Dana.
Hundreds of people.
What are you working on, Egon?
We'll do the happiness index next.
This is my address and telephone number.
Hiya, Oscar.
No, you didn't, Frank.
Hello, Peter.
So what happened to Mr.
What do you think?
I'll do it.
That's where the buggy stopped.
I wish I could stay.
So this is what you do, huh?
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman.
I'm sorry.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
They didn't find anything?
Maybe I should call Janine.
I think he likes you.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
That's a terrible thing to say.
Hi, Ray.
Is this the spot?
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.
Sorry!
Can I help you?
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.
That's quite a story.
Look, I've had it with you.
What is it, honey?
Who are you going to call?
Oh migod!
Have you made any plans yet?
Well, good night, Louis.
You're really good with children, Louis.
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.
Should we go?
Pleasure to meet you.
I'll let you get back to it.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
You know, I never got to ask you.
This is the one that looked at Dana.
You pitiful, miserable creatures!
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
You've got to do something!
These boys aren't playing around.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Sustained.
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
Can I have some of your water?
That's it?
Come on, Sherm.
This is my cousin Sherman.
Hey!
Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
I'll ask you again, Dr.
Egon!
I'd like to have a stool specimen
What now, Brainiac?
That's a thousand million electron volts.
You were supposed to help me with this.
That's it?
Boys, listen.
It's working.
So far so good.
Pretty impressive, huh?
Who was that?
Nothing.  Not a trace.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
Hey, I didn't imagine it.
I'm Egon --
No, not exactly a man of the people.
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
It won't work.
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
There's definitely something going on in that studio.
Is the line sinking?
Rivers of the stuff!
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?  Who?  Who?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
What's that?
I love this.
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
I'm Ray --
Careful, Winston.
Oh good, you're here.
And now you're going to eat it?
This is what you do with your spare time?
Like a goat on garbage.
Did you find anything at Dana's?
Beautiful, beautiful.
What happened?
Don't tell me, let me guess.
You should've been there, Venkman.
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Forget it.
I'll keep to the middle of the channel.
My Fault!
My great-grandparents were Swiss.
What's your story, Pete?
Ready?
That's it, Ray.
Give it up, Ray.
Does it have any favorites?
And he didn't die of old age either.
You got a flux and a half.
Now that's one ugly dude.
Are you telling me how to drive?
Are you all right?
Nice going, Ray!
What are we doing?
She's moving!
I don't care what you say.
Tell him about the toaster.
It better not start yet.
And pure --
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
How deep does it get?
Aren't you glad we waited?
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Now where are you going?
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!
Is it a star?
Ready?  What is it?
Okay.
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
Oh, no, I feel great.
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
Oh, sure.
Hello.
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Is that your professional opinion?
You play the cello!
You really don't act like a scientist.
That's too bad.
Uh-huh.
You're quite a housekeeper.
Damn!
Great rehearsal.
He is a very close friend.
Hey, Dana.
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Do you want this body?
Nothing!
This is going to cost you, you know.
That is one speedy mutt.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
What's that got to do with it?
Did you see it?  What was it?
You're very handy, I can tell.
I want you to have this. 
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.
Thank you for coming so quickly.
Can I help you?
May I please see the storage facility?
At ease, Officers.
You turned off the power!
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
Mr.
All right.  What is it?
Circle?
Nervous?
Hey!
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
Wait!
Yes?
Oh!  You're here.
Did you see anything?
Something was definitely here.
Wait!
It's Peter, Egon.
All right.  I'll try.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Where's the Keymaster?
Of course!
What now?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
No!
I just realized something.
Sorry, Buddy!
Ray!
It's working!
Set entry grid.
I've got to sleep.
What happened??!!!?
Look at the structure of the roof cap.
Excuse me for a minute.
What is it?
I told you it's real.
"Get her?
This is like a major disgrace.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
Everybody can relax.
Why don't I check out the building?
How was your date?
They will.
So do I.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.
Ray -- Something's here.
It's here, Ray.
Boy, that was a rough one.
Agile bastard, isn't he?
I couldn't help it!
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Very impressive resume.
Hey man.
Stantz?  You okay in there?
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
Where are we now, Commodus?
More wine, sister?
Quite so.
Don't you think you should at least wave?
Did Narcissus die today?
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.
Those are priceless sculptures.
It's disgusting!
How about in the forum.
Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
Tribuus... tomorrow.
Where have you been?
Now that is a happy sound!
Lykas, pick a man.
Damn him!
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.
Then you'd be out of a job.
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
You and my father have become very close.
Where is my family?
The army is a problem.
Endorse me in public.
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
The Senate is out to sink you.
Caesar, ignore them.
Gods of hell!
Throw it down into the streets!
Gladly, Caesar.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Where is my father?
Tribuus, what happened in the arena?
Why isn't he dead?
Yes, Caesar?
Tribuus!
You won an impossible fight.
The Senate too?
Who are you?
Is this Rome?
I came here to see that you stay alive.
Twenty years I've led men to die.
You cannot die.
Where are they?
I made the plume from a quail feather.
What the hell was all that about?
Serious stuff...
You brought the army into Rome.
What are you fighting for in here?
He's very realistic.
What about their philosophy lessons?
You need to come home!
This is our oil from our estates?
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
You're not going!
I'll never die.
You're a legate in the Roman army.
Who the hell are you?
Thank you.
Take your hands off me animal!
General, hang on.
No more bad luck now!
How much money is involved?
So, things change.
Let's talk about this later.
Commodus must hate you.
Hello.
You're living at home now.
Do you always drive like this?
Do you want some dinner?
Aren't you eating?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
Could you do it?
Will you take me home now?
I want to go home.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
Would you like to come in?
Where we going?
What is the matter?
Benjamin --
Ben -- what's happening?
Do you?
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Was she married or something?
All right.
What's the matter?
Why aren't you ready?
What is it?
Elaine --
No -- don't cry --
I'm meeting someone.
Where are you meeting this person?
Is that him over there?
I want to ask you a question.
I said I think it is.
Do you just hate everything?
Why?
Please let me go.
Don't tell me --
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
What are you looking for?
What are you going to do now?
Are you going home?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
Benjamin?
You won't?
Well -- look -- don't be confused.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I just don't think it would work.
Why wouldn't it?
Carl who?
How did he do it?
Are we getting married tomorrow?
Benjamin?
657-2036
Oh.
Ben!
Exactly how do you mean?
You a student?
What's that?
You're not one of those agitators?
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
What did you do to her?
See -- she's just having some water.
Mr. McCleery?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change?
BENJAMIN?
Mrs. Robinson?
I'm putting it on the top step.
I'm putting it here by the door.
Hello.
Can I help you, sir!
What?
Yes sir?
Is anything wrong, sir?
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Oh.
How are you, Benjamin?
Is there an ashtray in here?
Is it a girl?
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
You don't?
Thank you.
Will you come in, please?
What do you drink? Bourbon?
All right then.
Drink?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
What do you think of me?
Oh my God.
Aren't you?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
I think I'll go to bed.
Thank you.
What are you so scared of?
Don't be nervous.
Yes, I do.
Benjamin?
Hello, Benjamin.
May I sit down?
How are you?
May I have a drink?
He didn't see me.
Did you get us a room?
I got a single room.
Well.
Will you bring me a hanger?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Thank you.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Leave it on!
Can I take off my clothes now?
Do you want to hear it or not?
How do you get out of the house?
What do you say to him?
Well you loved him once, I assume.
Why did you do that?
And you were a student also.
What kind of car was it?
Don't talk about Elaine.
I wish you'd tell me.
Do you understand that?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
What are you doing?
Look.
Now listen -- this was not my idea.
Drive down the block.
Now it seems to me --
Mrs. Robinson --
Hello. Get me the police, please.
What have you done to her?
Ahh.
I say I've got it.
No -- actually I'm not --
Braddock -- Braddock?
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Can I talk to you a minute?
I drive around.
Why did you say that?
But I want you to.
It's pretty embarrassing.
Don't go on like this.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
They don't know?
When did you two talk this over?
I'm just --
Why?
Say that again.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons.
Wait a minute.
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
I drove -- I drove Mrs.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Thank you very much, sir.
How long have you and I known each other?
You have yourself a few flings this summer.
Hi, Ben.
Hello.
Now look -- please --
Hello.
Can you see me now?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben.
Is anything wrong?
The Carlsons' are here.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
What's happening?
Turn 'em up.
It's a short life and a gay one...
Have you a minute now?
I want to speak --
No --
I've quit.
Like dancing?
Never?
He must be very nice.
We'll dance.
I'd given you up.
Chasing around.
You were very different yesterday.
That was lovely.
Going?
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Poor little Grusinskaya!
Why do you look at me like that?
Why do you smile?
There.
Do you understand?
Grusinskaya --
Suzette will be back here any minute.
You must go now.
Bless you...
I'm worried about you.
Thank you, sir.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
The Baron is tired?
What?
Ready, Kringelein?
Is that too much, Baron?
That was my last.
I take five hundred.
Here -- here it is.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
It's always so quiet here.
The war.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
Aha!
So that's how we stand, Baron.
Hello! Hello! --
Is that for me?
For me?
For me?
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
Any letters?
Any letters?
Oh, but Doctor.
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Oh, I've got to find it.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
You may laugh.
Her master's voice!
You like music?
Dance then? 
Please -- please!
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen.
What's the matter?
Am I!
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
What...! --
Moreover --
Moreover...
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
What is this?
You...
You...
A man?
Don't misunderstand me.
No.
How nice -- your daughters?
Miss Flaemm.
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Can you pay some attention to me?
You are late.
Come here. 
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
What?
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
I know you did -- I said you did --
Sorry, Preysing. 
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through.
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
See you soon, Preysing.
How clear is Manchester?
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Shall I tell them again?
You're a deep one.
I can't dance tonight --
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam has slept well?
Madam should sleep.
What is this that you have cancelled your car?
Oh!
Hurry, Suzette.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along.
It is time for the performance.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
He will be on the train.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
Just one moment, sir.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
We will wait.
How is the house?
Four minutes past. Please come.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Next week.
What's the matter with you?
Hi, Bobo.
Well, I guess so.
One question.
You're calling the shots.
You ever hear about the oranges?
Permanent damage.
Almost forgot.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
Your kid's in the back here.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
I'll put you in one thirty-one.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Well.
Want a look?
Come take a look.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Demon!
Here you are! Two rich people!
Yes, yes, but that's --
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
It was a gift.
All right.
Whadaya say?
Kaggs. Home office.
What's up?
Sounds like a good Idea.
What? Me?
See you in a week, Roy.
And I'm Perk.
Good to have you back, Roy.
So what's your story today?
They knocked out my tooth!
Sure I am.
What happened to your hand?
I like those.
Not as tough as you, huh?
Up to you.
Lucky? You call that lucky?
You don't put up with that!
I tripped over a chair.
I just give you your life.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
What's that?
Expecting visitors?
You ought to put a bandage on that.
Well, sure, Roy.
Going somewhere?
Myra followed you, huh?
It is, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
I need this, Roy.
You want a drink?
I know what's bugging you, of course.
A bad mother.
What do you want me to do?
You're getting off the grift?
Well, uh...
There's nothing more to talk about.
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
You heard the shower, didn't you?
Joe, could we talk it over?
I didn't teach you that.
Let me see how you did that one.
Where's the five?
Well, well.
That isn't granite.
Roy?
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
Ow!
You were bleeding inside, honey.
Her job.
I don't see why you're still here.
Get well soon.
Big spender.
No.
The tap. What you do for a living.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
He didn't think they were risks.
Oh, Roy, it was great!
I just bet you are, too.
Think about it. Okay?
Yeah?
You -- I don't know.
You were gone for a while.
And hello to you, too.
Don't I get any say in this?
What is it? What's going on?
What's that?
You watch that mouth.
Roy Dillon?
I realize this is a shock.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Oh, Jesus.
That's that, then.
Mr. Simms.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Why am I here?
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Impressive, Blake.
Carter.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
That's it?
Carter.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
I'll be damned.
Mind if we sit down?
Bruce... what's going on?
A dead body?
Do you know who did this?
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
Another historical inaccuracy.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
What the --
I'm sixteen, Keri.
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
Alright, I was wrong.
Where are you going?
You're twisted.
Shit, John!
I'm sorry, alright?
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Now you're joking, right?
Where are you going?
He found you, didn't he?
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Shelve the barf bag.
Not me.
What are you doing here?!
You really think Eddie killed her?
You look kind of cold.
Better?
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
It's John, isn't it?
Hey, you alright?
There's something I have to tell you both.
Who?
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Keri, you all right?
Look, they're staring right at us.
Wait.
You aced it, didn't you?
Fuckin' A.
What's this?
Better her than me.
Ooooh, busted.
Shane's going as a condom.
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Let the party begin.
He do that to you?
Mom -- Who is this?
Hold on, hot lips.
Whatever happened to women in back?
Happy fuckin' Halloween.
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
What if your parents come home?
Aren't you gonna answer that?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Come on, Mom.
Mommy, I'm scared.
Mommy!!!
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
See what I'm talkin' about?
What is it this time?
I've been knocking.
What should I do?
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this?
My, God!
Do you know how insane this is?
God, what's wrong with him?
It was there when I found him this morning.
Where are you going?
Danny?!  Danny!
Where's the baby?!
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
What now?!
Come on!
Christ, what a night!
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
It was her voice.
What is that?
There you are.  Who was that boy?
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
Where's the child?
Come now, Sam.
You've created a monster.
No!!!
Yes?
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
What do you know about Michael?
Who else knew I had the baby?!
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Miss me, baby?
Home, sweet home.
Home.
You know what gets me?
You know what gets me?
You know what gets me?
I've been looking at motorcycles.
And how were things?
Otherwise, how are things?
Could have happened to anybody.
I dunno, boy.
What's funny about that?
Excuse me.
Go to the funeral?
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
So, kid--how they hanging?
Of course you'll go!
Hi, Penelope.
Hello.
Insurance!
What an awful sound!
Fifty years?
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
Anybody home?
You were about to ask a question?
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
Yes, wife, it is.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom.
Play?
A hundred dollars!
Dad--
What kind of exercise?
I'm a man.
Dad?
Mom?
What's this?
Then speak, by God!
I don't know what I hope.
How do you do.
"Hamburger Heaven."
Can I help you, sir?
How do you do?
What's the matter?
Bluh.
What's that all about?
You know what I want?
I'm so glad you like each other.
Harold!
He doesn't deserve this!
Awful.
Now that's what I call fun.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
Now--turn around, if you would.
I have some change!
Breakfast?
Chow, chow, chow!
Cook, by God!
I should have torn that door off its hinges.
Let me guess--breakfast is served?
I came for my clothes.
Things.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
See how you've upset him.
He's a child!
I'm going to call the police.
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
No, we won't.
I'm turning off the alarm.
Help your mother find the bullet.
How do I load?
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
She's right, Norbert--go home.
Give me that Goddamn thing!
Norbert--you come, too.
Ooops.
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
I mean--I can't leave you here.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
Safe and sound, I see.
How was the emergency, Doctor?
I feel the same way.  What next?
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
You can also describe its cure.
Wasn't that sweet of me?
Good Lord.
I thought she was a widow.
It died for your sins.
This is man to man.
There's going to be no bloodshed here.
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
You're a son of a bitch.
Hands and knees, you say?
You're in one hell of a jam.
Here.  Finish the job.
No.  No.
Can't do it.
Thank you--for my life.
Jesus--I dunno.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Alice got married again.
Dead!
And you, Colonel?
So long, you guys.
Mr.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
Because he was cruel?
She's my date tonight.
Don't touch me.
I worship your father.
Thank God!
That goes double for me.
Don't touch me.
And this is my son, Paul.
I hate that thing.
Where will you be?
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
Yes, he is.
Is Norbert still here?
Mom?
That's why I'm crying.
What are his symptoms?
Really?
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
We don't have a maid any more.
Everything stays as it is!
I hate that thing.
It came yesterday.
I didn't get his name.
Please--
Yes?
Coming.
Gentlemen!
What then?
Did you see him?
Did you talk to Paul?
What's the matter now?
Possibly.
It's true.
You and Harold are friends?
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
Oh no!
This is very good for us.
You know each other?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Get out of here.
You fool, you fool.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Do it!
Hi kid.
You've got to fight from time to time.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
Start with the smallest weights.
Kid--kid--
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
Hello.
No. I don't think so.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico.
No.
You're still dressed?
No, Felice, I'm not a cop.
Now, what do you want?
I'm getting angry.
Who is it?
Hello. You want some information?
Is this all the display space we can get?
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Are you the star of this picture?
Are you Niki?
It's your money. You talk.
Joanne?
Where is she?
Are you a private detective?
I thought you were going to bed?
No.
You have anything to drink?
You really shouldn't eat like that.
Don't knock it.
What's T-J?
You have to believe in something.
Be that as it may.
I is for Irresistible Grace.
Rot in hell, honey.
Why do you say that?
She left you right?
I don't blame you, Niki.
Did you find out where she was?
Listen, Niki.
No, I didn't think she was.
Hello?
This used to be a real city.
Where is she?
I bought it at a store in L.A.
Wait.
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim.
Oh, fuck off.
I'm only human, you know.
What are you doing here?
Where'd you hear that name?
What happened, pilgrim?
Andy, can you do something for her?
What is it, Jake?
What happened?
Is Marsha there?
How's your business, Jake?
Jake?
Wes, do me a favor.
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
Hey man.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah?
Hey, stop, stop.
I hear you got money to spend.
What do you want?
You wait here.
Where's Ratan?
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Who the fuck knows?
Fifty cents admission.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
No.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
I got a picture here.
Hold it, mister.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
What does that do?
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
I'm staking out this beer bottle.
I want to rehire you.
Maybe. Maybe not.
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
You can fuck off, too.
Jake'll take care of me.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
You are at the University, Candy?
He seems very nice.
Okay, lady. Out.
Haven't we met before?
But there is a family resemblance.
This way, Edith.
Oh.
And what do you do, my dear?
Edith was just telling me about her job.
What do you want?
Sorry I'm late.
Here's your shovel.
Eh, no. Thank you.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Do you dance?
Yes.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned.
Thank you, but it's an appointment.
Harold?
How about some ginger pie?
Do you often model for Glaucus?
A self-portrait.
What do you think?
Here we are, Harold.
You look as if you could.
Why do you say that?
Boy, Maude.
The universal language of mankind.
What happened?
Look at it, Harold.
Oh, my. We're too late.
We'll come back in the morning.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Thank you.
What's that?
No.
Oh, that was fun.
Okay?
I think he's following us.
He's stopped.
There.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
The ice is melting.
I like Glaucus.
Yes.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
This is really nice.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
It's sinking, Harold.
Oh, Harold.
Maude, I must speak to you.
But they'll put me in jail.
They'd put you in jail, eh?
Don't you advance on me.
Just like this.
That wasn't very scary.
How about some candy floss?
You sure have a way with people.
Look at the stars.
- end where I began.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
It looks like you. Thanks.
I was remembering how much this meant to me.
Supper for two.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Oh, Harold!
I feel giddy.
Chardin.
Please, don't you realize?
Mother.
Love?
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
This is insane.
How do you do?
Would you like a cigarette?
Is Sunshine your real name?
Do you play?
Oh, is this your father?
This one is particularly interesting.
I see.
Harold?
We are not relating today, Harold.
I see.
Let's examine the facts on it.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
Parasite!
Harold, calm down! This is...
Stay where you are, Harold .
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Ah!
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
It's different for us.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
Well, well.
Oh, right.
See?
He... he loved me.
Daddy!
Yes... Yes. You look...
It's a beautiful dress...
She's done it.
I want to go back!
I knew you'd come back.
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
Sad, huh?
I... I had a visitor.
Help.
No bad dreams.
And you're sure it was a woman?
Don't worry about it.
The box. I need the box.
What?
Get out of the way.
O.K. Let's go.
I have to go back.
I'm scared.
Well... G'bye.
But I didn't open it!
Wait!
What is this?
I... remember.
Where am I?
What was it, kid?
I thought Steve had talked to you?
He talked about Demons, huh?
What the hell are you asking me for?
Easy, easy.
I need to touch it to "see"...
They were over here, Professor.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue.
Don't get psychic with me.
How am I ever gonna get a girl?
Would'ya look at this babies?
Hey.
Nah -- he's taken care of.
You were burned by some organic acid.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
That's all for you, Sammy.
hound of resurrection --
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
This is an important mission, Sgt.
Sgt.
You are a Catholic??
Here. You'll need one of these.
The freak in the gas mask --
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
It's almost over!!
Do you believe in hell?
What the hell was that? An ape?
A 16th century statue was destroyed.
Son. About Rasputin --
Don't look! Turn around.
How many buildings does she have to burn?
It's her choice --  She's human --
How does he know so much about me?
And as a father, I worry about him.
Who's the squirt?
I don't want him.
Well, you did break out --
Hey, hey, hey.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped.
C'mon, champ.
They're not speaking.
He gets fed six times a day.
Oh, Jesus!
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
Sir, may I go first??
That voice --
She's dead.
Names hold the power and nature of things.
You will never fulfill your destiny.
But not everyone was so lucky.
"One falls, two shall arise.
We've installed a very handy timer.
You'd better stay here.
Thank you.
You're kidding --
Oh.
Whatcha looking at, John??
Helping you -- I just --
Myers??? How's your arm?
I just fried Stinky.
What took you so long?
You want me to hold him down?
Down there.
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes.
What was that??
Where do you --
Myers, you're a talker.
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Anything else you --
Are you sure about this?
Keep her safe.
You better have that looked at.
We miss you at the Bureau.
Goodnight, then.
It's nothing.
Hi.
Okay, someone's expecting us.
Liz -- can I call you Liz?
I admire him.
He -- loves you.
It's freezing, isn't it?
But it's not true, is it?
Hit me.
Hello, I'm --
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Christ!
You fucking ass-holes.
It's my lucky day.
What's happening?
Will you sign for the bed?
Alright, let's give it another try.
That your daughter?
Oh.
The box... you opened it. We came.
This isn't for real.
He doesn't see us, or hear us.
Let me alone, will you?
No time for argument.
Nobody escapes us.
Suppose he HAD slipped us.
We want the man who did this --
Just in time.
We've got such sights to show you --
Please. Get back into bed.
Please listen to me --
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Julia!
Kirsty.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
No.
Come to Daddy.
Oh my God.
You bastard --
You're Julia, right?
There is going to BE a wedding?
Well?
What about Larry --
Wedded bliss?
Julia.
Help me.
No. God no.
...somebody...
You can't let me stay like this.
I'm hurting
-- to heal me completely.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
Well?
A long time.
This is what began it.
You can't love him.
She'll tell them everything...
Kirsty.
What happened?
Kirsty? It's very late.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
No, damn you --
It's ONE of these.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
It smells damp.
How long since you were here?
Why didn't he want to sell it?
Not exactly modern.
You're still blaming me.
All right.
Larry!
Where are you?
He's here?
Well?
How are you doing through there?
What have you done?
Is it deep?
It's probably going to need stitches.
Take it slowly.
Would you excuse me?
Julia?
Are you all right?
I'll be O.
Just a moment.
Who was it?
Is this upsetting you?
Are you all right?
-- I'll go see.
Larry...
Oh baby.
Huh?
What's wrong?
Dead.
Not much fun, is it?
What are you drinking?
Well, isn't it?
Is this your place ?
This isn't the bedroom.
What's going on?
I suppose not.
First time for everything.
Why don't you take off your jacket?
Why don't you do the same?
You know, you're very beautiful.
Oh Christ.
You're awake. Good girl.
Who brought me in here?
What a pretty tune.
You wouldn't believe me.
Well, if you change your mind.
Who's there?
Kirsty?
Well I want you to see the house.
Great.
Big house.
Are you O.K.?
What are you drinking, love?
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
...maybe we should never have come back.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Would you... maybe call round sometime?
I have to talk to you.
It's all right, sweetheart.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
Get the fuck out of here.
Where are you going?
We're on the Cointreau.
I won't be able to stand.
You're not going?
Need any help?
I'm here.
You know I do know the way home.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house?
I beg your pardon?
Oh no?
Oh!
Are you busy after work ?
Steve. Thank God you came.
These THINGS... they want to take me --
What's wrong?
What?
I'll come back later, huh?
'Bye.
Do I know you?
Alison's.
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
Really?
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
What are you doing?
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Nice, Barry.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!
Yeah.
I wanna date a musician...
What did you tell her about the shop for?
What?
Okay.
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot.
Why would they care?
Fine by me.
Un-fucking-believable.
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Don't be sad, Barry.
Hey.
Isn't it?
What's up?
The little skate-fuckers.
What the fuck is that?
Like fuck you are.
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.
Great.  Can I have it then?
Why not?
Well what about the new Echo --
That is perverse.
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
What?
He's got one!
Who are you going to see?
Anna.
Don't do it, Rob!
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack.
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz.
Hey, Barry.
May I help you?
Right.
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Hey Charlie.
'Morning, Dick.
What's this?
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
Are you all right?
I always hated this song.
Let's not.
Rob.
Rob --!
Well we rang $900 today.
Don't worry about it, Dick.
Can I do anything?
What is this.
Laura?  Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Can I help you?
What needs sorting out?
Good.
Good.
So shall we leave it at that then?
You don't have to go this second.
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
Shit!
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?
Hey!
But Laura.
Yes.
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
So.
I'm sorry.
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
What?
Did you say something?
Look.
Hi.
So, how are you?
Hello.
Are you still in love with me?
I called and called but you were out.
I'm sure.
Fix it up.
Don't forget your CDs.
Hello.
Are you alright?
I'm sorry.
Me?
Look, are you coming or not?
You're soaking.
I can see why you say that.
When are you going back?
Hello.
You know, with Ray...
Look, we can do other things.
Laura...
Let's go home.  Okay?
C'mon.  I want to know.
Oh, c'mon, Laura.
Look, Rob.
... Like Mexico.
Hi.
You did that deliberately.
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
They'll go on early.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
What are you going to talk to me about?
I'm an idiot.
Rob here.
What's the -- hey, Liz --
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!
Enough, Liz.
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
So you live in Chicago now?
Don't you like that?
Hi, Marie.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff.
You share a place with T-Bone?
Books, records, films -- these things matter.
Are you okay?
Would you like me to turn the lights out?
Which way are you going?
Yeah?
Hi, Mom.
She left.  She's gone.
Hello?  Anybody there?
What do you think?
Look.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Eno import.
I think you have more.
Jesus.
It's rough.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
Well, the cream of society awaits.
I warned you.
Doesn't have a head, does he?
How's your uncle?
Would you like more tea?
He was unsual.
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
This is against the rules.
Taupin, Richard Marshall.
Do you play?
Byzantine?
Good reflexes.
Someone beat you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I have friends.
Jesus Christ.
He tried to kill me last night.
Who is he?
What will you do now?
He sees me as a threat.
No.
Is this what you killed them with?
What's all that?
You did kill those men.
There was a man once.
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
Maybe it would do us both good.
Here, try this.
I don't know any of these.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
You're using your son's name.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
I must be insane.
Who are you?
I carried that rifle in World War I.
Don't.
What is it like?  Being you?
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.
What's wrong?
What is it?
Get out.
The emptyness.
Life.
It will be horrible.
Forget it.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?
Forgers do it all the time.
A murder.
I'm calling an attorney.
What are you going to tell them?
Corey, you _owe_ me.
Good way to lose your job.
Who is it?
I don't believe him.
Someone should check him out.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
Be quiet.
Afternoon.
I did at that.
I was driven out.
Hmm, que rico.
He told me there could be only one.
It is as you are.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
Three days you've laid there.
What is to become of me?
Why does he want to kill me?
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
Impotent cow.
It will take less effort as you learn.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
You're no match for Scot, Mr.
What is the fascinatioon?
Go ahead, Senor.
I'm your future husband, remember?
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Oh please.  Another one.
That's wonderful.
David.
Who am I deceiving?
State of grace and all that.
Not so scared.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
Finish your prayers?
Complete your inspection?
Eat up Dupont.
Your name?
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Help?
We must talk.
Do not turn your back on me.
You see Major?  You are not so different...
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Here.
Fish are creatures of habit.
Should have seen him the first night.
Are you sure?
Where!
Smith.  Carl Smith.
_Answer_ me.
Spare a chair?
How are you?
Old habits die hard.
And have you something to settle with me?
Had a great swing with his blade.
He found us even there.
I haven't drunk this much since-
I love zoos.
I knew his great-grandfather.
Long time.
You've been here from the start.
Friend of yours?
Run!
You disappoint me.
What's the point?
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
We have some unfinished business.
Yes laddie, I have her.
This your present address?
What were _you_ looking for?
Do you know what this is?
My condolences.
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Morning Mr. North
Nothing to be sorry about.
Hello, Harvard!
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Are you back?
Who is it?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
How do you mean?
Duffy!
Let him have everything he wants.
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I'll keep you in mind.
Oh, it isn't like that.
Too hot?
Say, what's happened to Burns?
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
All right, dear.
Hildy Johnson.
All right.
What's the matter?
That's right here.
Hildy!
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Oh, she was here.
Hildy! Where's mother?
Here it is, Bruce.
Just a second, Walter.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy.
Mr. Burns --
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
Mother? But your mother --
Well, I'll try to give her one.
Mighty nice little town, Albany.
How's business, Bruce?
Anything the matter?
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
How long would the interview take?
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
I don't know.
Well, she'll know some day.
Don't want to forget this, you know.
Well, I got to get back.
Hildy!
And I'll take that certified check, too.
Oh, this is all right, Bruce.
I can explain that, Hartman.
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
No?
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
Call Duffy!
What's this?
Does it?
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
Save that for the Tribune.
What do you want?
How long is what?
You're repeating yourself!
Was it my fault?
Sweeney!
Then what does he want with you?
Allow me.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
What now?
No, Bruce, dear.
How can you have any happiness after that?
Now you're talking!
What do you think I am -- a crook?
Exclusive? That's great.
Well, I'm coming to it.
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
Where do you think you're going?
Not if he's inside the desk.
Hildy!
Hildy!
Well, keep going!
Double-crossing swine!
Tear into it, will you?
Bruce ought to be back by now.
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
Where is she? Tell me!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
It's Fate, Hildy.
Look at me, Hildy --
Hello -- hello...
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Ring that number, will you?
Don't open that!
No, you don't! Walter!
No!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
When did you deliver this first?
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Sorry, Hildy.
Well -- what is it?
Hildy!
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody.
What!
That's what he said the last time.
How about Bruce's?
Hildy, darling!
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Come on, Sheriff.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Down Western Avenue.
Butter-fingers!
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Anything you want, Boss.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Walter!
Don't blame me.
Here's that certified check, Walter.
Hello, Hildy!
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
There's money in it, Cooley.
How much?
Let's see the money.
The newspapers!
I don't know --
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
Well, that about covers everything.
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
I call. What you got?
Who locked the door?
Open up there, will you!
Hey!
Kind of exclusive, ain't you?
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
A fine bunch of reporters.
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Boy, did you see her go?
No, I tell you!
So have we!
Come on, you!
Come on, Pinky!
Hold the phone!
I'll call.
Goodbye, Yonson.
What a chase!
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
We know what you're up to.
How's everything, Gus?
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus!
Gus, this --
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
No, thanks Sheriff.
Just a minute, Johnson!
Take your paws off me!
Let me go!
I don't know anything, I tell you.
Where'd you get this?
He's harmless.
That's murder!
Where is he?
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
For who?
Read it!
Well, wait a minute, will you?
Just one second --
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Now, listen, Fred.
Pete, you're through!
Pure politics!
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
No -- don't out me off.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen?
We'll fix that, too. 
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
Fine work, Pete!
Who is this man?
You drunken idiot!
That's a lie!!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete.
And so do I!
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
Got you, Williams!
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
Oh, I ain't doing that any more.
Wait a minute, Walter.
Where's the old lady?
We run smack into a police patrol.
I'm telling you.
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!
Gentlemen of the Press!
There goes another scrub lady.
Hello, Mr.
Any news?
You fight it cut.
Certified, eh?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Did you get that, Hildy?
Okay.  Forget it. 
Look out, you --
Have you got my dough?
You know it is!
Kings and sixes.
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
Hiding him where?
Mother!
I don't know what she's talking about.
Mother!
A gun?
Don't forget about production for use.
You're not going to shoot me, Earl.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Don't talk too loud.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk.
What good'll it do?
Come on, Mollie.
Where are they gone?
What's that?
They'll get him! They'll get him!
I'm coming!
What's the idea?
Hey --
Are you all right, now?
What do you want?
They were all standing around when he wrote it.
Now, listen!
Who? Me?
Now, listen.
Why not?
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
Get out of here!
They wouldn't take it.
Here's the picture of my wife.
If you ask us, no.
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
Look out!
Get the cops, somebody.
There she is!
What's your hurry?
Baldwin -- his name is.
Who?
The door was locked.
What's that?
Can I try?
Never let a rat creep up on you.
That was a googly!
This is going too far, young man.
Give him the you-know-what.
You miserable little tripe-hound.
It's true.
Pauline's mum got killed.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
I never was.
I know a secret.
My uncle's in the War Office.
You want to join our gang?
Well go on then.
That word is special.
He's never going to come back.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
I did see them. I did.
You're the biggest fibber.
The next one is ours.
Can't we just see the end?
Well, I'm not having any.
Crocodiles! Aah!
But Dad, It's the News.
You said that last year, Dad.
What's that?
Take it away.
Boy, that was some air-raid.
What is it?
...It was a toss-up.
And Jim.
You're a mug, Clive.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
What kind of war is this Mac?
What about it?
How's your war, Mac?
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
So you're going to be a grandfather.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
No Turks.
We all had to write a last letter home.
Has Sue got it right?
And what's that?
We don't know anything about it
Well?
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
You know it?
He always knows.
Tell me the truth.
And where do you think you're going?
I want him.
What is it, pet?
What did he say?
I don't believe this is happening to me.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Is it peace in out time?
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers.
It was the best time of his life.
I can't do it.
Please yourself.
It seems to have survived.
Mac, that was wonderful.
Remember this beach, Mac?
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
He could always make me laugh.
Bless you, Mac.
What did I do to deserve this?
It's not fair on them.
It's so far way.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace.
I don't know how you cope, Grace.
Molly!
You're having me on, Molly.
I'm so glad you could come.
Whoa, thanks for stopping.
Oh, I know.
I agree.
Tiny's home.
Ma, Tiny's in.
Drink up, it's party time.
Who's your Daddy!
What about the tree?
Which way?
OK, whatever.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
How much further?
The door's locked.
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
Thank you.
Hey, great they're back.
No!
I'd like to see that.
Can I help you with something?
What the hell are you laughing about?
He walks, duh.
Take that, you fucking slut!
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
Come on, bro. Let's go.
What's this?
How long have you been running this place?
No, really.
Really?
I'll pump the gas.
Holy crap.
Keep straight on this road here.
Come on, we need something like this.
It's a hitchhiker.
She looks like she stinks.
What was that?
OK, let's relax.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Almost there.
I like sleep.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Fuck! We are fucked!
What's he so excited about?
Just grin and bear it.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Should we stop?
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Why are we stopping?
Go around him.
Hey, he moved.
Fine. I'll go straight.
Forget it. I'll just go.
Check this out.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
What are you doing!
Come on, get with the facts.
And...
I.
Fascinating.
Ya hear me?
Fuck your grandmother.
Huh?
No, he's just joking.
How long is that gonna take?
Huh?
Great, you're back.
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Ugh, what's that smell?
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Fuck, it's freezing.
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
Thank you.
What are you laughing at?
You gotta be kidding me.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
Let's just skip it.
Don't even say it.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
How long has it been?
What was that?
I don't hear anything.
Jesus Christ.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
A couple hours!
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
What'd we here, Georgie?
God damn.
What'd ya got there?
Great.
For the show.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
I'm gonna go ask him.
We hit the jackpot!
Just back up.
I'll go. It's my fault.
Hold on, hold on!
This is way too fucked up for words.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Why? Why are you doing this?
Where is he?
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
What are you doing?
Well hello, officer.
Thank you.
Grampa... watch the language.
Otis!
I don't know. I only saw one.
Get in... now!
Hey.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Turn up this road.
We gotta break it open.
Tell it to my daughter.
Jesus Christ.
Mr. Willis?
What about the body you found?
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Plates match.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home.
Wydell.
Over.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
Tell him, Harold.
Tell him, Harold.
Lila, what are you doing in there?
Hello, my little boy.
Say my name.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Only three shocks.
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
No.
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Oh, Doctor.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
Shall we close up, then?
I am sleepy.
So soft.
What is wrong, my darling?
Dr.
Yeah.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
My little French.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
You were wonderful today, darling.
Yeah? What?
Call you back.
Please. Just one minute of your time.
Like what?
Well, I think...
Well?
You were wonderful!
Lila?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
I want our boy back.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
My apologies, madam.
It shan't happen again.
Very well.
You what?
Nice night.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff.
He's dead.
Progress!
So?
No maid service!
How'd you know where I was?
I don't know, honey.
Done!
Uh, tie them up, Rosie.
I'm going to miss you.
I'll be in touch.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
It looks wonderful.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
Boy, this is good!
What are you doing in there?
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Oh, darling.
It'll be wonderful!
Shaving cream?
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
Did you see that?
Come on.
You'll catch cold.
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who from work?
It's hormonal, Nathan.
Was that okay?
So, how's it going today?
Everything's fine, honey.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan?
That's great.
Oh!
How's work?
Hey!
Bravo to you, Puff!
I think he's ready.
You just have to control it.
Puff, I'm proud of you!
You were gone a long time.
Shut up!
Aha!
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
Oh boy!
This is great, Puff.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Did I?
Free to come and go as you please.
Thanks to you, Nate.
Interesting.
Ugnh.
Puff, put the gun down.
You did create me in your image, Nathan.
Wait!
Mother?
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother.
Boys just passing through?
Thanks.
About sixty, seventy bucks.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Give me a bottle of beer.
Huh?
I'm ready.
What makes you know so much?
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
It's all right, Eddie.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
I want to talk to you.
You bastard.
I'll make it up to you.
Are you ready for another?
In a little while.
Put it on the bed.
Could be.
We'll be there.
How much?
Have you noticed, Bert?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Will you take a check, Bert?
Hey, mister.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
Okay?
Make it twenty.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
I'm buyin'.
Hey, wait.
Hello, Eddie.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
James Findley is a very rich man.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
Here, I got it.
Fine.
Hey, Findley's here.
So does Eddie.
What's the matter? What happened?
Well, we won't.
Sure.
How do we stand?
I can beat him.
I'll beat him the next game.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I can beat him, Bert.
Please don't get off me now.
I wanna walk.
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Maybe. You want to play?
He's my partner.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Druggist supplies.
It's gonna cost ya money.
You ought to take up crap shooting.
Well... well, now.
It's quiet.
Ten grand.
How do you feel?
Quit. He's too good.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
How much we got?
Twenty-five hours, Eddie.
What are you trying to do, Eddie?
Is this all we got left?
You walked out on me like that.
With what?
HOW MUCH?!
Just like that?
No, no more for me.
Findley.
I'll bet you do, Mr.
When?
You gentlemen care for a drink?
I thought we came here to play pool.
Beautiful shot, Felson.
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
There it is. I'm broke.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Hey, uh, mister?
What's the limit?
Hi.
How much you playin' for?
You quittin' too?
You better not miss, friend.
You quittin', friend?
Long wait for a bus?
How long you been waiting?
What time does the bus leave?
Have a nice trip.
Have a nice trip?
It's the lights. And the scotch.
Why did you do that?
What time is it?
Oh, you need a shave.
I got my things over at the hotel.
Where you been all day?
You were asleep when I left.
I'm hungry.
Oh, cut my finger.
Eddie, what's in that case?
Do you want me to go?
You going out?
What are you writing?
Give it to me.
You told Charlie to lay down and die.
Who is it?
What happened?
You can read it, if you want to.
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
You glad?
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
Well, what's so funny?
What is it, Eddie?
No, I want to walk.
Fifty-seven.
Where's Bert?
Go on back to the hotel.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie.
Now and then. You know how it is.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie?
Boy, he is great!
And them fingers, them chubby fingers.
Your shot.
Very good shot.
Preach!
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
I came to play pool, Fats.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
I quit, Eddie.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
Are you all right?
How much do you remember?
Do you remember where you lived?
Who is this?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
Do you remember where it is?
You want to find them.
Why don't you start with me?
What choice did I have -- ?!
What do you want?
Will you keep feeding me?
Mine.
That's who you are too, Emma.
You want me to stay?
Do you still want me to stay?
Emma...
You have to go.
Good evening.
I remember the first time we met.
You and that damned garden.
Need some gas?
Hell of a night.
So, what do you do?
Bathroom?
Son ... are you awake?
We're going to be moving, son.
What's that, Dad?
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
Wow.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
There are more this year than last.
... and Rigel.
Which one's that?
Well, son?
Jim -- what's wrong?!
Are you sure you saw that?
Are you all right, Dad?
I lost it.
I had an awful dream.
... And then everything blew up.
I know, Ellen.
It's probably the solenoid.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
I'm home now.
You know, it really is beautiful up there.
What's wrong, Ellen?
What do you mean -- gone?
What did he talk to you about?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
This is a new town for you.
That's quite a story.
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
Do you know how to follow a map?
Jimmy, calm down!
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
I swear it was here.
They'll get us.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
Stay here.
Did you call the State Police?
No one comes here after dark.
Damn.
What is it?
Don't go in.
You're looking for life?
Well, come on, you two.
What do you think he saw?
George, where have you been?
Your father asked you a question.
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
When?
It's all this moving from place to place.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
Penicillin.
This could be our last night on Earth.
What do you want?
What?
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
What do you want me to do?
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
Just my luck, no ice.
You still believe in him.
Thirty seconds?
With you?
Are you all right?
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
He still gets air sick, huh?
Spunky. He told you about that?
You saved a lot of lives.
We're losing them.
What the hell is this?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
There's good news and bad news.
I've got a lock on the signal pattern.
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
Then what?
What are you waiting?
Pops!
What the hell is that?
Not listed, huh?
Perfect, she's using it.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud.
Dad, please...
David, David!
Pops, you're a genius!
Thanks, Pops.
I have a confession to make.
What the hell are you doing?
Must be thousands of them.
Get us out of here!
What're you doing?
Nice meeting you.
We're loose!
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command.
Is my wife in the air?
Any news on my wife?
Where are they?
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
And our forces?
How're we doing?
Grey, you read me?
Where's it headed?
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command.
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
That's impossible...
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency!
This is ridiculous.
With their shields down it might be possible.
A meteor?
He's trying to impress you.
You can't go. Call them back.
Wait. I have to tell you something.
You're late.
You're late.
You scared the hell out of me.
Your son.
So, what do you do for a living?
And when the dancing's over?
Dylan, come here.
I don't believe it.
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins.
That is an affirmative.
I shouldn't have left her.
Damn it!
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
Stevie... I can't...
Stop it.
I don't need it.
But I gave you some this morning.
They let you out?
I couldn't find anything.
How' he doing?
I'm not leaving.
What the hell's going on?
Mr. President?
Call them back.
Mr.
Can they be killed?
Why did you people come here?
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Yes, but don't panic.
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
My reputation precedes me.
Yes.
Yes.
May we go home now, please?
Marcus!  I did it!
Your treat.
What has the old fool got himself into now?
Dad?
Venice, Italy!
It's Dad's Grail Diary.
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
Ah, Venice...
That doesn't look much like a library.
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
How's the head?
What about you?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!
Marcus!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Henry, the pen --
Look what you did!
The Word of God...
Indy!
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Are you expected?
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
Well, it's sandstone.
The Arthur Legend.
Hard to resist, isn't it?
DONOVAN!
Impossible?
I'm through!
Doctor Jones?
And my mother's ears.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
It would make me very happy.
My dad sent me this Diary for a reason.
Bingo.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
The Ark of the Covenant.
It must be one of these...
What's that?
Don't wander off.
I said go around!
My room!
This.
At least I let you tag along.
What do you know about this place?
What are you going to do?
This one. I think he's in here.
How did you get here?
You came back for the book? Why?
Is that what you think of me?
All I have to do is squeeze.
I never expected to see you again.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
Elsa.
Dad!
It is you Junior!
Oh, it breaks the heart.
No!
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time.
Found it.
...you did it.
You didn't, did you?
No! Don't Shoot!
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
What am I looking for?
I ought to tell you something.
Dad!
What?
This is intolerable!
Dad!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
Stop!
You're going the wrong Way!
That's for blasphemy.
What did you get?
Did I ever tell you to eat up?
Well... I can't think of anything.
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Dad, are we hit?!
Nice landing.
Those people are trying to kill us!
This is intolerable!
What do you think you're doing?
Now, who are all these people?
Dad?
Dad?!
"Only the penitent man will pass.
The penitent man is humble before God.
Junior, give me your other hand!
Elsa never really believed in the Grail.
What did you find, Junior?
I like Indiana.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
Get that camel out of the way!
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
I'm going after those horses.
Sallah, I said no camels!
Why are you trying to kill us?
This is your last chance.
All right! Where's my father
Interested in local curios?
Charming.
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
I'm sure it's nothing.
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
I believe we're being called to dinner.
Jones isn't in his room.
Who?
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
They will escort you to your rooms now.
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
I sense the fumes of opium in all this.
I would say you look rather lost.
I had a question, Mr.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
I was dubious myself at first.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory.
You understand what he tells us?
Dr. Jones.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones?
You have insulted my son.
What's that?
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Indy?
Indy, they make our plane crash?
I ride with you, Indy?
Indy, look!
What you look at, Indy?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
He was afraid of you.
What does it mean, Indy?
This is Nainsukh -- from the village.
Come one, what's wrong?
Let up on the brake!
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
There were five stones in the beginning.
That's far enough!
Give me the stones!
No, the stones are mine!
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
Was the stone very smooth?
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
I like the service here.
Listen, we just met for crissake!
You don't look very good.
What're we going to do?
I'll take the extra ticket.
I'm freezing.
Are you crazy, a lift raft?
You all right?
India...
What'd he say?
Took what?
And then they took their children.
What'd he say now?
Indy! Help me!
A what...?
Hurry, help me out of here!
Don't let it pull you deeper!
Listen, Willie.
What's happening?
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai.
What about the future?
I'd like to find one of those myself.
I think you should sleep closer.
Couldn't keep away, huh?
He's afraid of something.
Any more complaints?
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Not leftovers?
You're nice.
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
Primitive sexual practices?
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
Oh no -- oh no!!
What?!
WILLIE?!
There's bugs!
GET US OUT!
A fulcrum release lever!
There's a hole!
What is it...?
Oh my God!
Let's go!
Wait -- what're you doing?
It's okay. You're all right now.
What?
Indy? Did you talk to them?
What're we going to do?!
I can't!
Let her go!
Anymore ideas...?
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
The last Sankara Stone.
I get it!
Give me your hat...
I said something.
No, not her. Me.
My name is AL.
Where are you,...Al?
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Arrrgh!
Al.
You're in my head...
Somebody's been here.
Who are you?
Quit screwing around, this is important.
You've heard of the PEM114...
Are you threatening me?
Look!
I know...it sounds insane.
What are you doing?
You're not crazy.
You'll be alive.
What was that?
You weren't listening!
No they won't.
Anyone there?
Behind us?
What's that?
What'd he look like?
What do I do?
Now what?
I wouldn't say that.
Get your breathing down.
I want out.
Calm Down! Act rational.
I don't know...To get Al.
Did you hear that?
It can't take that long.
JOE Or what?
They could put you back in the tube..
They'll have to take you apart.
Sue them.
I don't like the sound of that.
Now what.
Which way do I go?
A lab and equipment.
Like the guys that attacked us.
You need ID in there?
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
Wait a minute.
I'm back.
Who is it?
Don't talk, I told you.
What is it?
What do we do?
You mean...just leave.
What about money?
...and a license to kill...
They'll know who I am.
It's just not enough.
Now what?
Holy shit!
Do you notice anything.
Take it easy, now.
Here.
Now what?
Al, are you doing anything in there?
Beautiful!
She's...pretty fast.
What is it?
You're beautiful..
Help me out, will you?
What do I do?
.
Wait.
Where is she staying?
Touch her.
...Joe.
What happened?
Where are you going?
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
Now, where would I be?
But what's it look like?
What is it?
You really like that shirt?
Much too blue.
Mind your own business.
Not that tie with that coat.
What did that cost?
Which one is she?
They both look good to me.
Get close to them.
You got a better idea, you tell me.
Who are they?
Follow that busboy.
I feel like an idiot.
Which one?
Just don't show fear.
He recognises you, throw him off.
Joe, be careful!
They're all in it.
Even Rene?
What is it, your charm?
It's embarrassing.
What Happened?
She's got the most beautiful...s
And on my time.
No.
You been had. We have.
Some agent you are.
Bingo.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
What do I do?
Come on, she's getting away.
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
Sapporo..
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
What are you doing?
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
Don't touch a thing.
...drink it.
What next!
I can't...
What are you doing?
Ow!
Door to the right. Get up and run.
What?
He was with Gruner!
Hiroshima!
It's him.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
You sure this will work?
What was it? What'd I say?
haka xuki.
Left...The one with the red dot.
He hung us up dry.
It's in the watch.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
Do it.
Are you alright?
Aim just in front of his face.
Holy...
He aready made the deal..
There's a lot you don't know.
This may hurt.
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
Do something.
What happened?
Be quiet.
I can always flush you down the toilet.
She is beautiful.
Not really.
I know it's no good.
You're a lucky man.
She's so lovely.
Awwww...
Don't worry, I owe you a lot.
What are you doing?
JOE What abilities...?
I've got twenty hours left.
You just got a Mickey.
Not that truth!
Sorry...
Doesn't matter.
I've seen that before.
What is your name?
No!
I'm against it.
Can you fly this?
I'm...scared.
I didn't do anything.
Nice?
What kind of a deal?
I knew you were trouble.
What happened?
They have stolen state property.
I knew he was following us.
Impossible.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
You've cut your hair?
PEM115!
How about a deal?
Surveillance Cameras?
We'll have to let them go.
What Job?
Who is your friend?
Well, I'm glad to see you.
Yes?
I don't want to intrude.
Al Viola.
...Foreign service.
What brings you here?
And...you know Jan Gruner?
Joe.
Al?
Ahhh...nothing.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Sue who?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
You may you find all the solitude you want.
Don't do it!
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
Now you know what I know.
The fresh tuna?..
Yes...What is it?
Oh...and who is it!?
What do you do about what?
Is someone else here?
...Blake
Blake said that?
I'll be right there.
And you.
I can't do that?
What's so funny?
Wait. What's your name?
You mean from it.
And you?
You again.
Promise you what?
Joe! What happened to you?
Why did you leave?
Why did you stay with me?
You're leaving.
You know where he went?
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
You don't believe me.
What's Gruner like?
Where we going?
This boat doesn't go anywhere.
What?
Now what?
That must be him. Water taxi.
Where what?
Wait a minute!
Why'd you ask him.
What?
Chiang Cho?
So do I.
Why not?
What happened?
Are you alright?
What?
What a mess.
What?
I'm sorry I got you into this.
I encouraged you to come here.
How?
Now what?
Uh.
Don't worry.
Just like that?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Kiss her you fool.
Who are you? Who do you work for?
He can't help us.
It was me.
Come on.
Riuji?
What is it?
He wants to apologise.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
What could you find in this place?
Excuse me?
I can't.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
Is there anything else?
Wait.
It's alright.
Mom...what are you doing here?
Right there.
This the only spare?
Ow?...
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
Look, nobody knows we did it.
It'l take months.
Hi, honey.
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
I'll take some.
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
He's into kind of little cars, that...
Let me tell you something, Lowell.
Just ran into two of your "geologists.
When's your deadline?
Are you all right?
These are their leads, their sources.
What does that do?
Shit...
When's the air date?
What was that about?
Yeah.
Can I go to dance tomorrow?
Do you want more rice?
What are you cooking?
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
"Tortious interference"?
Yeah, I heard rumors.
So, what are you going to do?
I'm staying right here.
What the hell are you doing?
And what are you implying?
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
A gun? Yes.
That bullet was for a .
That computer has everything...
Debbie...
Shall I send for coffee?
Mike... Mike... Mike...
What does that mean?
Hey, Lowell.
Hi, baby.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Hello?
Here's how it works.
Lowell?
I can take her.
Uh, what are those boxes?
What's going on?
...taping?  What are you taping?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Thank you, Bob.
Oh, someone took a poll?
No classes this morning?
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
What's wrong?
Jeffrey Wigand...
Yeah...
Is it too late?
Oh, my God.
Yes, I'm right here.
Has he decided to go public?
Yeah, I'm here.
We're there.
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
So, is everything okay?
Thank you for saying that...
Oh, man.
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
I discovered this.
Lowell.
I've been banished.
Yeah.
Did I get you up?
How many shows have we done?
Mike... in my...
That Canada story? Still interest you?
C'mon, it all worked out.
Coffee?
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
Who's that?
How do you like your coffee? Black?
I know what I have to know.
...but that's as far as I go...
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
Should I just take the documents now?
...protect your sources...!
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
What do...
And, I'm unemployed.
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Seven dwarfs?
The new place? New.
How'd you know that, Lowell?
Hello. You there
What did you get us?
You believe that?
Excuse me. Yeah...
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
Good. But Jeff...
Lowell, I can't afford --
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
You attract a crowd.
What's changed?
I told the truth!
...I was young.
Yes.
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
That's the whole point, Jeffrey.
I've got to teach class.
You manipulated me into this...!
Where are you, anyway?
I think I need to call the police.
Did he hear you?
What about now?
What's happening?!
Just give me an example...
We have a couple.
What are you talking about?
I heard you.
Jeffrey, how are you?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
All of us did.
"I would bet on it."
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Object to the form of the question!
Hello.
Jail?
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind.
Is that a threat?
Yes.
Yeah.
Sixteen years?
Baby. You are so HOT!
Oh.
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
No!
What a touching story.
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
-- understand what you're asking for here.
You're in a rush.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
That's his lawyer.
You're calling me a pestilence?
Lemme tell you something.
Objection, your honor!
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
Objection, Your Honor.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
You're in check.
I'm happy for you, pal.
I have it.
They won't get a conviction.
My God.
I'm sorry to hear that.
She's rich.
Who was that?
Marylin! What have I done?
So who'd you hire?
It was like that scene in The Godfather.
I begged you to have a baby!
You're vulnerable.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
Is Tong older than Ming?
Well.
It sounded like a bell.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth.
How nice.
These are yours.
I assume this is on Rex?
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Tell me Mr.
I'll have the tournedos of beef.
All right, Miles.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
He'll regret this.
Oh, for the love of...
Getting married.
I'd like to offer my congratulations.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
To victory.
Hello?
Screw you, asswipe!
You have a very nice home, Miles.
Is that you?
Hmmm...
And here I thought my mother was...
We're damaged goods.
Friends?
I have to say -- I'm speechless.
I want to be your -- your wife.
I don't have a ring!
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
No.
But?
I'm sorry.
Honey, I could sit...
Here's my card.
Hi.
You don't like me?
Miles.
Well.
Comfy!
I'm clean with the IRS.
STUFF.  Got a light?
Arty Farty stuff.
Hello?
It's a no go, Joe.
Wait! He works for YOU?
Nonono.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Hello Marylin.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Pre-Castro.
Sweet.
Rex. Get away from the door.
Hello, Rex.
Do you need a Tagamet?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
I'm sorry. Where were we?
I was devastated. Of course.
Who's that?
Is this a lover?
Forgery and Fraud?
She's a legend.
Miles Massey.
Who's she?
Maybe.
Please.
I don't know what his game is.
Lilly's up.
Every week --
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence.
That stinks.
You're not...
Sarah Sorkin.
Is this Ming?
I can't do this anymore.
What?
-- is not a challenge.
Wait. I know you.
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
Herb wants to see me?
Mr. Massey --
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
What?!
So, Miles.
-- So much for the icebreakers.
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
...arty farty!
Where does that leave us?
Mr. Rexroth.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
What's Kirshner?
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Wrigley!
What the hell is wrong with you?
What do you think?
I'm sorry I'm late.
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
Wrigley?
Yes.
Extinguish?
Now, Mrs.
Hi, Sweetie.
No.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
It's not so bad these days.
Thorstenson Gieselensen.
That doesn't make sense.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
OhMary
Can't you get them to go any faster?
Mr. Warne?
I was surprised to get your note.
Here you are.
What's this about not eating?
Know what my next move is?
Come on, Ellie.
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
Where are you taking me?
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing.
Ellie
What's the matter, Ellie?
Yes, I guess I have.
Peter Warne! 
Looks like that was his only interest in me.
I'll be going.
On a hunger strike, huh?
It's my daughter! Go after her.
What a hell cat.
Why; naturally, I
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
Try.
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
What happened?
Here's another wire, sir.
Never mind, son.
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Me?
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
Whadda you want!
What do you think you're doing!
That's a long story, my friend.
Oh, yeah?
Driver!
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
I beg your pardon!
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
Oh, thank you.
Remember me?
What's the matter?
Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami.
Here, boy!
Of course I do. What do you mean
A dollar sixty!
Now, just a minuteyou can't
Hey, Brat!
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Chalk up one for your side.
That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own.
Do you mind putting out the light?
Who are you?
Here
Where'd you say the showersand thingswere? 
High time you got back.
Very outspoken, too.
Detectives!
Yeah.
Don't get excited, Peter.
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Say, you were pretty good.
I better go over and see her.
Poor old Shapeley.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
This looks like the best spot.
Peter
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
What's the matter?
I wasn't gone more than a minute.
Sure.
I am.
What are you thinking about?
There it is.
I wish you wouldn't talk too much.
But the thumb always works.
Here comes a car!
Something must have gone wrong.
What're you going to do?
You might give me a little credit.
What were you going to do?
Oh, Peter!
You don't have to eat the carrots.
Any luck?
Yes.
Thank you.
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Better go back to your bed.
I hope you got your money.
ONETWOTHREEFOURFIVE
Maybe I could jump out of the window.
No, it isn't.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
No harm in your coming to see us.
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
Where's the bus to New York?
Eight o'clock tonight.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
What's the matter?
Can I use your telephone?
You made no mistake sitting next to me.
Hey, what's this?
Oh, by the waywhat's your name?
I've been thinking about you.
Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!
I'm hungry.
The old man's screwy!
What's up?
Mr. Gordon
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Collect?
Get out of here!
Joe, listen
A thousand dollars!
I met her on a bus coming from Miami.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
'Bye, Agnes.
Hello, Joe.
Funny couple, ain't they?
You send telegrams here?
There you gotrustin' people again.
I told you!
See that. They're gone!
Thenyou'll have to git !
Not a minute!
Well, you're two up on me now. 
Huh?
What's up?
Lucky thing, my running into you.
Where do you live?
Gee!
Boss, Oswald impersonators?
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.
What was his voice like?
Recall any names?
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?
Who the hell opened my files!
Maybe there's more to this, Susie.
Who?
Or a cover up!
Bill.
Who do you think fed him that information?
Correct me if I'm wrong.
What do you think, Lou?
It's addressed to no one and no signature.
Yeah.
Clay Bertrand?
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Did he pay you for this?
Fuck, yes.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
Lord, wake me, please.
I'm lost, boss.
But why?
Can you get some sworn statements?
Those bastards!
All right, all right.  Break it up.
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?
What's it look like, Nick?
...Oswald?
You know damn well who it is.
Somebody planted that fucking story!
I'm caught in the middle.
Dave, I always play square.
What about the mob, Dave?
Come in, Dave.
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
Let me get this straight, now.
Then who killed the President?
Shit!
I don't remember his name.
Dad, look what I drew.
Daddy!  Where have you been?
Are we going away, Daddy?
I'm scared.
These new people never identified themselves.
Don't get sidetracked!
...now it gets positively spooky.
I don't believe it!
I think Clinton is a breakthrough.
Aren't you being a little hard?
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I understand.
Who?
Let me show you his picture. 
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
One hour, y'hear?
Honey, you all right? 
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?
No.
Hi.
Did they live?
Nothing is going to happen to you.
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
Honey, some crackpot.
Honey, come on.
Well so do I, goddammit!
And if you're wrong?
They killed him, honey.
For sexual purposes?
What's wrong, Lou?
Oh no!... How bad?
I know David - a strange character.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
Post Office.
Graveyard dead.
Can we find her?
Mobbed up all the way.
Goddamn Sam!
Time?
Who do you think changed the parade route?
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Hell, you're the District Attorney.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Jim Garrison?
I don't.
Well, thanks for coming.
He's done it before.
I knew the man 20 years.
Here's my problem, Jack.
How much more?
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Where is Banister in all this?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
No, she could get hurt.
Hate mail here.
Sure sounds like he's winning.
I don't think so, Al.
Welcome, Mr.
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
I know about that shot.
I'm going to be very frank with you.
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
When are you going back to Washington, sir?
Can I help you?
This looks pretty good on me.
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer.
I don't know.
I understand.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
What the fuck can I say?
You see, it works like this.
Hey, c'mon in, man.
What's the problem?
Fuck that shit, man.
Answer the question, nigga.
Does he have the marked bills on him?
Why were you with him?
You got a good lawyer?
Great, you're here.
What's going on?
We are. Don't worry about it.
Can I have a word with you?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus.
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
This is your money?
Hey, this is my office.
I'm not a loser.
Help yourself.
My pocketbook.
What's this?
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.
Help us do what?
But now you're telling us now you do.
You don't want much, do you?
How was your flight?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
Are you really a bail bondsman?
I gave you my card there.
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
You gain weight?
You're not tired of it?
What have they told you?
You know who put the dope in your bag?
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
He's the one who wants you.
What'dya think?
If you're having some.
You get a chance to use it?
Thanks, but I have my own now.
What, I couldn't hear you?
Somebody loan it to you?
Want to hear some music?
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
This is pretty.
I called in sick this morning.
He had his doubts at first.
How do you get it out?
How do you feel about getting old?
My ass ain't the same.
Does something else worry you?
Well, hello.
I walked right past you.
Does it happen to all men?
Who was your girl before Annette?
What're you, a bag lady?
Will Ordell go for that?
He tries to act cool.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
I'm not sure you answered my question.
Don't even think about it.
The feds. It's evidence.
You're rationalizing.
It'll be more than that.
How'd you find out?
Ray wants him.
That's why A.
He's already there.
I got your package.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
I saw Ray the other day.
That's Ordell's.
I didn't use you, Max.
Where're you going?
Wanna go?
He say we like the same thing as married.
Most of the times.
Sometimes every day, for a while.
Yes'm.
Oh, Miss Brown?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
Look, that shit ain't mine.
We'll just be a minute.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie.
Oh, so now you know him?
No shit.
This is A.
I'm recording this.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars.
You said that the last time.
That's fifty thousand, huh?
Ever been tempted?
I thought I did.
Where's the bag she gave you?
We had our agent on you.
Louis Gara's dead.
Oh, hi.
Sure.
Killian's.
How long you been with Ordell?
Mr.
He said he didn't know about it.
You think I'm kidding?
Jackie?
I put a little cherry on top.
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
I got some vodka in the freezer.
For what?
Beaumont Livingston.
Yeah?
What do you think it is?
What the hell you doin'?
I just came here to talk.
Let's get realistic, baby.
Yeah?
I got a problem...
Yeah.
The Cockatoo Inn.
You told em?
You told them that?
...I make two deliveries.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag.
Drink?
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises.
Who's paging you?
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry.
It's boring, isn't it?
Want a hit?
When did you get out of jail?
Is it ready to go?
You okay?
Want a Metrix?
Which one?
You're fourteen years old here?
That was taken at a place called "Flippers.
Were you a disco guy?
Wanna fuck?
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Is it dead?
Well, so far he is.
That's not what I'm saying at all.
Please.
We're leaving now!
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
That's a nice outfit on her.
What are you doin'?
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
I'm carrying it.
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
I mean it.
Thanks, Baby.
See, what did I tell you?
I got me five M-60 machine guns.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Who was that?
I didn't look like a bum.
How much is there?
Can I ask you about Melanie?
Uh-huh.
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
It's Louis.
You shot Melanie?
Louis?
What'd you shoot her with?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
Jesus Christ.
You see Max Cherry in the dress department.
I'm going out for a few hours.
You're right, that was Ordell.
How can I help you?
That's Winston. He works here.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond.
It's in my bag.
Who's it for? A relative?
What's his full name?
Getting there.
Beaumont Livingston.
Across the street a Great Western.
Hey, Max.
Comfortable?
Somebody already did.
Where is it?
What's up with this shit.
You know who this is?
You still there?
I'm alone.
That's all?
Jackie didn't trust Melanie.
This place stinks.
It's the next street.
My money's in that office, right?
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Who is it?
We're back.
Hey, hey, hey.
Ha-ha-ha.
Hello.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
He ain't here right now.
Get me out of here.
Remember?
Dream on!
Go on Jake.
Hiya Jake. That was some dance.
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
By who?
Something weird is going on here.
Grass never did that to me.
Too late.
Daddy!
You have an unusual hand.
You know, you got a strange line here.
Hello.
Daddy, what was that noise?
Wait ... Daddy.
Doctor.  Ph.D.
Who's been talking to you?
Listen, will you listen?
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
Bullshit.
What'd he say that for?
What do you mean, demons?
He was scared.
He say what they looked like?
You think they're connected?
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Not me, buddy.
Come on, Professor.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
Loves me!
God almighty. What did you do to me?
Perfect.
What are you doing?
Are you in the service?
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Christ, I know how it sounds.
Demons?
Not according to my charts.
What was that?
What a dream I was having.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
Jacob, what can I do?
My back.
They stole it.
Jake, is that you?
That help?
What do you think?
You up?
Thanks.  What's that?
Look at these, will ya?
Is that the one who died?
Wait. Don't.
Ready?
Jake!
I'm going home.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake.
It's still there, Jake.
You okay?
Can't you stop it?
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What does it say?
What the hell are you doin'?
What'd the doctor say?
He's coming right over.
You're out of your mind.
I can't do it.
Don't gimme that.
Help me! Help me!
Jake.
Look, I'm horny.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
It's just me.
Why are you doing this to me?
Don't!
Who was that?
What are you doing here?
This is one of my dreams, Jake.
I want to go with you, Jake.
What're you ... ?
What's going on?
What's wrong, Jake?
WHO ARE YOU?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
It's going to be all right, Jake.
Why won't you answer me?
What'd you do that for?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
This isn't happening.
Oh God!
WHO ARE YOU?
Surprised, huh?
So first I'm arrested, right?
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up.
None of us can remember that night.
I always suspected the effects might come back.
You come here often?
I think I'm falling asleep.
I can't move.
And no more demons.
It was paradise, Michael.
Here.
How 'bout over there?
Where's Wong?
How was Palm Springs?
No.
He's burning up.
Throw that torch away, young man.
Clear the area. This is an order!
Dream on!
He's burning up.
I'll page him.
Well, don't we look better this morning?
This is not a dream!
Hello.
Paul!
Jesus, man, you look terrific.
Still married, Jake?
That's as straight as I can put it.
Sorry.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore.
Can I help you?
I'm so sorry.
Do you want me to get someone?
I have some ice from the machine.
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
He's not part of the program.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Okay, enough of this shit.
I don't have all day, kid.
Duck fuckers?
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
Just make a break for the door.
Goodbye old friend.
It's locked!
What are you doing?!!
What's that?
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Can we blow it with just two?
His mother?
Minimal.
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating.
Hurry up, guys.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters.
Bomb?
Blowing the walkway?
Can't shut em' down from here.
Sergeant!
Uh-oh.
Okay that hurt.
Where have you been?!!
Where the hell were you?!!
Creepy.
Nice touch.
You see that?
Better let me.
Everyone okay?
Shit!
We're not supposed to do that.
I'll need system four converters.
Hey! I'm not ready.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Kay-Em!
Done!
Goodbye, my love.
Brodski!
We'd need charges.
How many?
Where is...?
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Then what do we do?!
Hurry!
It bought us some time.
Earth II.
Boeman, the ships not here.
Get them in the lab!
My god!
Jesus what the hell is that?
What the hell are you doing?
Wait a minute...I need...
Yllo, what's your head count?
Got it!
Yeah, I got ya.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Sergeant!
I'm with you kid.
He's dead.
I doubt that.
We need weapons.
Jesus, God!
Report to weapons.
You sumbitch!
Kicker, anything?
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Where is everybody? What happened?
Pull me in!
Where are you going?
You just need to relax.
Outta here?
Rizzo, he's out there.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt!
We're screwed!
What if you miss?
Rizzo?!
Hey.
What's this?
That's why I'm here.
My father's company imports and exports.
Jason seemed to have the right stuff.
They were all wrong.
I couldn't save them.
See? We're not so bad.
You know, this future shit sucks.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
His mother was killed before his eyes.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Rizzo, you okay?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
Rizzo, pull away!
You okay?!
Now what?
It's time.
Spunky . . .
Well?
That's really funny.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
Yuck.
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
I feel better.
It's on the table where I left it!
Kaboom.
Okay?!!
I'll help you in.
Oh, shit.
Push off toward us.
I...I don't know what I did...
They're not gonna make it.
And what's with the headgear?
Now that's just gross.
Now this is getting exciting.
You must shut down the engines.
I'm missing two!
Hey teach!
Oh my God .
This is what it means right here.
I'm gonna spew.
You think it killed .
Hurry! She's lost it!
YeaH, GREAT IDEA!
You're so bossy.
You're quicker than usual.
Jesus!
What are you doing?
What do we do?!!
I'll tell you where he is.
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
No.
I don't know...sorry?
Robot huh?
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
The cryo unit leaked.
I didn't say I was good at it.
It's just you and me, then.
Almost done.
Sorry, sorry.
Do I have to?
Kay-Em, you okay?
You did good, Kay-Em.
Kay-Em we made it!
Kay-em you okay?
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
Kicker!
Leave him behind!
I don't understand...what does he want?
What?
How do you know?
Something's wrong.
The power's back up!
Damn!
I'm sending you the files.
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Where..?
Jason? He's on this ship?!
Jason!
Azrael can you repeat that?
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
You're not going anywhere.
What good will that do?
Guys, please come with me!
How do you open the damn door?
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
What have you done?
Yes!
Listen to me.
Can we get through these?
Guys, he's right behind us!
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
Son! -- Out of the water now!
My cars. And a comic book.
Did you bring a check?
This is Matt Hooper...
Hey.
You got it?
The wire's showing!
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
I never saw one that big.
Why don't we go in?
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
What's that one, there?
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
That's it! Radio in for help!
Did you get him in the head?
What about us?
He's trying to sink us!
He's chasing us!
He's comin' up -- !
Right.
Did you burn another kettle?
You want to go through those?
Don't forget these.
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Be careful.
Love ya.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Can you stand something to eat?
Mikey loves his birthday present.
It's three feet deep, Martin
How come you have to tell them that?
You too, sweetheart...
Home... New York?
Colorful, isn't he?
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
Martin!
Now tell me something I don't know.
I can't work in a vacuum.
I'll get to that in a minute.
Only 24 hours!
Who's that young man?
Why not, Larry?
She's right.
He lost it on the way up.
We have got to close the beaches.
You'd love to prove that.
Got a pen on you?
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Drowning.
What's that?
...Nothing.
What is all this stuff?
Where'd you get all this?
What happened?
Don't they have lifejackets or something?
He didn't have a dinghy aboard.
You all right?
Wait a minute! I need you.
I hope we get some more help.
This has got to be one big violation...
What's that, a ship?
What the hell?
Don't shoot him any more!
Quint...?
What day is this?
Christine what?
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
We're not even sure what it was.
Look, I've got to talk to her.
You wanna call it a night after here?
Leg of lamb this time?
Look at him take it!
Hi.
Would you like something? Some coffee?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
...push this?
What have you got there, Lenny?
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
I've been to sea since I was 12.
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Ha.
Hey, Squirt!
Hello, Junior.
What's that supposed to prove?
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Watch it!
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
Gettin' ready to run again -- no?
A marlin, or a stingray.
Over there!
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Wire burn.
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
I'll drink to your leg.
...Mako.
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.
Easy! It'll tear right out!
Coming right to us!
He's heading under -- !
Follow him!
What can that gun of yours do?
That's disgusting!
I'm sorry, Martin.
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Sick vandalism!
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running.
Hey Bleek.
So, what do you think we should do?
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
What's up?
Really? What are they like?
Jesus, Bleek.
Well, we were once.
We're getting a stretch limo.
You're being really immature.
That's not how our thing works!
Wait, let me take that.
Wizard!
Hey man.
What? I'm not made of stone.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
They could be utterly negligent.
Nails? Really?
Just tell it to me straight, Bren.
Juno?
I have no idea how to spit this out.
Oh, God...
But they have a real lawyer and everything.
No.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
That was a mistake, Juno.
We don't even have a dog!
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow.
Shit.
So, Juno.
Yeah.
Good.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
No.
Whoah.
Whoops!
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
Oh.
It's beautiful.
What is that, Mahogany?
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Juno?
Right.
Why aren't you at work?
Behold, good sir!
What is it?
The Wizard of Gore?
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented.
This is even better than Suspiria.
Vanessa.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Cold feet.
Hello?
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Cool.
Oh, Mark!
"Most Fruitful Yuki"?
What?
Oh, okay. Like this.
I'm leaving Vanessa.
No.
But I thought you'd be cool if...
Please don't get a divorce!
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Juno!
Hi!
Can I take your coats?
I'll get drinks.
Oh, that's marvelous.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork?
Oh.
Juno!
Is the baby okay?
What...
Oh my God...
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up.
Right.
Well hi Vanessa!
No...
Oh my God -- It moved!
Juno? What's going on?
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
Would you like some free condoms?
You should have seen this octopus furnace.
Do you need a large sum of money?
Who is the kid?
What?
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Damn skippy, you're not!
She's joking.
Excuse me?
Hi Dad.
I sort of already have.
What?!
Well, well.
Maybe you're having twins.
Well, you know where the lavatory is.
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle?
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
So, you were bored?
Aha! You love him.
What are you doing here, dumbass?
The Penny Saver sucks.
Best to just tell them, man.
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
Aw, please Junebug?
How do you know I'm so poisonous?
Yum.
Hly shht!
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
No way! She's pretty.
I want a huge cookie.
God, you're getting huge.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Hello.
You don't say.
So. What's that thing?
You guys are playing music?
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
That wall is going to need something.
Juno, what's the matter?
What did you do?
What would be a good time for you?
I called Gerta Rauss.
We're actually, finally doing this?
No.
You lose!
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em.
Hi, I'm Adele.
...Pardon?
What?
Are you takin' the pictures?
You dropped this.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
...Hey you're good.
I'm cool.
What's this?
You took this picture?
That's me.
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
My momma's a beautician.
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele.
Happy birthday Adele.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
What if they're dangerous?
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Geez, they look kinda weird.
Shush, Adele.
Early, what're you doin'?

What's wrong with her?
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout?

That bad?

Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
So tell me... what happened here?

You two been busy in here.
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
Just being there where it really happened.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
Hey.
So how's it going?
...and I think I know why.
What did he sound like on the phone?
I like that.
Feel sorry for him?
All set?
Who said he's my good buddy?
Stop being so fucking melodramatic!
What is it?
What's that?
There's more...
I'm scared.
Brian I want him out of our car!
Carrie... stop it.
You gotta talk to her.
Carrie, watch for Early.
What about you?
Any word from that gallery?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Bri'.
...Need a hand with those bags?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?

Early, just think...
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?
You were plenty hot.

How old you?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Well, girl.
Shit.

Well, how was it?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.

That girl you boned last year. Remember?
But that's the thing.
I hate this game.
Man, this guy is really good.

I don't understand why you do that.
So really, it's good luck.
How much you gonna take?
About ten. Fifteen is good.

I was lookin' for you all day today.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
Come on.
Do you like kissing me?
Uh huh.
I'm nervous.
I like you so much.
Nothing.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Who are they?

You know it won't hurt.
Dance!
Telly is at Steven's?
How old are you?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Jennie.
Can I ask you a question?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Sorry.
Miss, would I be prying?
Now that's it.
I swear to God.
Your a real philosopher.
Hello.
Telly says was up.
The pain. The fucking pain!
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
Right.
Yep, yep.
Like where are your erogenous zones?
I hate sucking dick!
Wish me luck.
Shh.
I gotta go.
I'm coming.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
I'll ask you one last time.
Yeah.
I was like yes!
And you don't get shit out of it.
Yep.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yep.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
How can you hang out with Casper?
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Yep.
Hi mom.
Sorry.
Mom.
Hey Mom.
Hello?
What are you guys doing?
So, how many people live here now?
That's the whole thing.
First times are always wacked.
Slow.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
It was... it was.
What man? What is it?
By yourself?
We seem to have a little problem here?
Casual.
What's that supposed to mean?
What do you mean, no?
Morpheus.
Are you crazy?
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
No.
You got it on the board.
He's not talking about himself.
Then let's narrow it down.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
Yes you are.
The message!  I figured out--
You want me to what?
Debi Rutlege.
What do you think?
Take it easy.  Both of you.
No shit!
Sorry.
The F.
You still having a problem with this?
We've checked.
How is she?
I spoke to Jeremy.
What is it?
Ready for round two?
You should be an actor, Frank.
Why does he call Sanderson?
A few people.
Don't fuck with us!
We'll find the evidence.
Hello, Peter.
Hello, Peter.
Very amateurish, Peter.
And -- what path is that?
I did another one last night.
Hello?
Just for that no hint today.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Have you any idea what the message is?
What?
It's you who's running out of time.
Hello.
Interesting concept.
Hello, Peter.
Yes?
That wouldn't be very sporting.
I know where you are.
This isn't going to help, David.
Don't you see?
Naw, it's all fixed.
What's this?
Sure.
Nope.  Nothing.
D2-d4.
Now what?
There's three.
What is it?
Computers.
You might not have done it had you known.
The police came to me for help.
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Feeling better?
Kathy, please.
Why did he?
You must be Erica.
Is your dad here?
Do you like my dad?
I know he really likes you.
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
Congratulations, dad.
What are you doing up?
Who told you that?
What is it, dad?
You ready?
It isn't Kathy.
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
There's no blood.
Anything?
He tapes their mouths shut.
This is where he forced his way in.
Same as the others?
Well?
I'm busy right now.
No.
Kathy?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.
I don't think it matters.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
As large as castles.
What time did he get there?
He's right, Kathy.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
And what if he's wrong.
Did you see his face?
Could you tell me where you were last night?
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.
You want me to go with you?
What have you come up with on the riddle?
That's it?
Another one?  What word did he leave?
As large as castles.
He's using the map as a chessboard!
It's a commercial area.
He's not going to give us direct hints.
A shadow.
Where were you last night?
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?
Alright, c'mon Peter.
Did you send the car?
You opened with the English.
It's a good play, but risky.
We got a problem?
Peter...
You have something you want to say?
What do you see here?
She went into town with Mrs.
Bainbridge Books.
Bainbridge Books.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
Is this your first time here?
I love this hotel.
Are you with the tournament?
--but you enjoy being the stronger one?
Well, I think I've had enough.
What are you looking for?
They couldn't break the riddle.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
It's going to be a long night.
I think it's interesting.
I'm just curious.
No.
Relax.
I know you didn't
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
What?
Nobody could attack you.
I just don't want to fight with you.
You can turn everything around so easily.
I'm hungry.
Fine.
Did you call?
They're not delivering.
Peter, you have to admit--
Peter...
Hi.
Peter...
This letter.  I've never opened it.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
You're right.  The killer told me.
You're going to be late for your match.
You beat him.
It's over now.
Hello, Peter.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
Take off your clothes.
There.
I lied.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Have they harmed you?
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Lyssa ...
Colwyn ...
Will your power outward.
Take the western passage.
Yes.
Lyssa ...
In the Arctic ice.
That's a better one.
You'll both wait.
They have Lyssa!
You will go alone.
The White Castle has fallen.
There is nothing.
You choose these?
They know when they're going to die?
I can't reach her.
She can't see out.
I cannot reach her.
No.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
From here, I must go alone.
He ran a great risk, helping us today.
She must make a glaive.
The spiral begins in the west.
She's on the other side of this wall.
You must move quickly.
How did you know?
Slayers!
Do not let the waters touch you.
They can be saddled.
It is today?
Each to his fate.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Am I not worth returning to?
You too are lonely.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
Once is enough, thank you.
Not yet, my friend.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
And where do you lead, boy?
When did you last sleep, boy?
They burn many villages.
I'm not hungry.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
Well, I'm not impressed.
You've eaten nothing.
Forgive me, my friends.
Go, join them.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
You're resourceful, my lad.
A good thrust, my friend.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
You!
What is that awful looking place?
Where are you going?
A venison pie as big as a house.
Quell?
My heart stays here.
I'm hungry.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
What?
We meant only to please you.
But also very young.
Put me down, you lout!
What are you doing with my dear?
Oh, my poor stew!
Passable, pimple, very passable.
Look at its beauty. Look at its grace.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed.
He didn't join them. They joined him.
They'll trample him to death!
I do not want your power.
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
It's a lie!
He will come for me.
What news from our friends?
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
You were attacked in the forest?
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one.
Modred! Impossible!
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
Can you see?
Knowledge I wouldn't want.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
I must go to the widow.
Few have survived it.
Each to his fate, lad.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
Look.
Kegan!
Go now.
Who speaks that name!
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
Do not try your trickery on me!
You see?
Memory is no trick, it is a power.
It will not help.
I cannot stop the sand.
What's that man's name?
Give me his name, I will mail him.
Yeah, pal!
YEAH!
I can't believe it!
...You moved too, didn't you?
No, no.
Why can't I have a bank account?
Take...
OK, I'm fine.
Rocket launcher.
Wow! It's brilliant!
Who'll I aim at?
The fat man down there, on the bench.
Good! First shot!
The yellow and pink.
What's up?
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
Come on, get down!
Mathilda? May I come in?
Why don't you take me with you?
May I go to the cinema?
...You can leave whenever you want.
Not taken.
If you knew, Leon...!
...I'm going to kiss you.
Stop. Everyone is looking.
...Shit!
Where are you going?
It's too big.
Risky business, isn't it?
Poor darling, and then?
...Don't you drink?
...No...
How many girlfriends did you have?
...That's awful.
May I ask you a personal question?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
No!
You say it just to calm me!
Yes?
...Yes?
Don't fear.
How are you, Miss?
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
You can't sit here like that.
...OK... Good.
But... He works for your same employer?
...Who sent you?
Is he still alive?
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
Salute.
Do you recognize him?
He probably just went somewhere.
What is it?
This smells good.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
And your store?
What if you don't make it?
Nothing's going to happen.
Are you two planning kids?
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
I have to finish first.
What would you like us to do?
Mine.
Are you a preacher?
A wife?
What steps do we take now?
So what's the deal Maurice?
I know what you're getting at.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
Yes?
You thought I sent them?
Have I forgotten something?
It's a special day isn't it?
Ellen?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
I do love you... very, very much.
Walk with me?
I thought we both wanted the same things.
I want children.
It isn't going to make it Ellen.
Your father?
I don't know.
I know where my heaven is.
Why there?
Maurice?
The beach of Pacifica, California.
What did they ask?
To where?
Why?
You don't have to prove anything to her.
What's his story?
Red flags man.
A marriage certificate?
Hansen's whipped.
Shit!  He jumped!
Well, hello.
I thought you were asleep.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Each inch represents 150 miles...
Three thousand miles?
This story is big huh?
What are you saying?
What happened?
I want to reach people.
Are you firing me?
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
When are you leaving?
I'm walking there Kris.
Phileas Fogg?
You're walking to California?
I'm really lost.
Tom Joad?
I missed you Kris.
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
Are they standing?
Come on Mr. Parker.
We do the operation after I finish.
She knows you love her Mr.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
What do your friends call you?
You're in pain.
... My father.
Good morning.
Is it a boy or a girl?
I don't have kids.
Where did he go?
Hello, Mr. Parker.
What's your shoe size?
If that ain't fate?
I've always wanted a watch like that.
I really want that watch.
Hello!
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
You're pretty drunk.
Sarah -- with an H?
Umm.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
Do you want to fuck now?
What's the story?
If I was I'm sorry.
Don't run away.
What's up?
Yes.
This is the home of an angel.
You OK?
I'm rambling.
I'm from the East.
First.
It wasn't so important to me.
How long have I been here?
Don't you like me, Ben?
Sera... what you don't understand is...
Hi!
Want a drink?
Ben?
Sera, I love that name.
Why?
Right.
I'm going to fill it right now.
Giving you money makes me want to come.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
How are you doing?
Why don't you go back to sleep.
Very creative.
Your color.
What was that all about?
Please!
I'll be back home around three.
I like it here with you.
I've missed the best sun.
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
There are limits.
I wanted to see you...
You know I love you... yeah?
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
How'd this happen?
About ready for another drink?
Please don't raise your voice.
I don't want this.
You have been lonely?
You have been lonely?
Where have you been?
Don't hit me.
Yes? What?
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
Go, Sera.
Harvard Law School?
Well, then.
What alibi?
Why would I kill my husband?
Brooke, I believe you.
Were you with another man?
What're you so happy about?
Is he always such an ass?
Are you okay?
Elle, I can't.
It's so shameful...
No!
What's going on?
Did you hear a shot fired?
Yes, Your Honor.
How many, would you say?
Dewey Newcomb?
Come again?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Did you get it?
Why the hell not?
What are you talking about?
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
Sit down.
I'm sorry, but --
I think it's time discuss your career path.
You're hitting on me?
You're not going up there.
I do. I'm not allowing it.
What did you see when you entered the house?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
What's going on?
Why didn't you call me?
I'm sorry?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
Yes?
Yes?
-- his life?
You can't even imagine.
After you went to all that trouble?
Is she?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?
You showed up Warner in class?
You ready?
God, that felt great!
I feel so bad for her.
Good one.
You can't go home!
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
Our group is full.
The idiot speaks.
I believe her, too.
It's not my alibi to tell --
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
You almost had me fooled.
I'm a bitch.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Why else would she have flown in from Newport?
Too demure?
I don't know!
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Honey, stop!
Here. You're gonna need this.
It's Elle!
Oh, how sweet!
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
You have Stromwell.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Good luck.
Don't ask.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
I can't believe you called me a butthead.
Damn.
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
She's not!
How can you still believe she's innocent?
The what?
Okay, how would it work?
What the hell is that for?
You really think I'm attractive?
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Back up.
Hey --
Whoa -- Why?
So now you're -- ?
Oh, my God!
Up for a celebration dinner?
Someone missed you.
No -- it's just -- not me.
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
How could this happen?
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious.
Almost.
What're you doing here?!
You guys -- I can't.
Neither.
Yes? Ms. Woods?
I did?
It's pink.
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
Amazing how?
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
You don't really believe she's innocent?
Class schedule, map, book list.
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
You're beautiful.
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
C'mon. Let me take you home.
What're you talking about?
Oops!
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
Good. Good.
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Wow. You're a walking felony.
I didn't mean --
You look -- nice.
Pink ones.
Thanks for the backup.
It made me realize something.
In court. On opposing sides.
Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
She's naked.
Hovering?
Elle?
Is it a Kappa?
Oh, God.
Let's all go! Road trip!
Why?!
There he is!
Why so few?
Fool's magic.
You go?  Not watch fun?
We come watch... we come watch...
What?
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
Birdies... pretty...
We watch... good fun...
More fun win battle?
My generosity is not so large as that.
God protect me.
Damn you!
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
No more... please...
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
You're a beast!
What was that?  Did you hear that?
What you do, boy?
No, wait... please... listen...
Friend Ogg.
No!
Enough!
It's bluebells!
Damnation!
You be our guest, Jack.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
But... but, why?
Someone worthy of respect, lad.
Are we here?
Here now.
The princess is dead.
There it be, lad.
By the grace of God.
Shhhh!
What is it?
Pregnant, is she?
Damn them!
Fine-looking army.
We must follow that bird.
This is ogre's magic.
Worse than the battlefield.
Good.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
Nice piece of work.
My God!  Look!
Shhh!
I should hope not!
I pray always to be worthy of it.
Make haste!
God's blessing.
What make ye of that, Jack?
Wait!
Archers!
Is she... dead?
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump.
Wait, Jack.
Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!
Aye.
Can we trust him?
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Give in to despair and all is lost.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
Water doesn't burn...
One more turn...
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Jack!
Will you explain what's going on?
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Can't we move any faster?
He's getting away!
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
A good day for singing...
Keep me belly full, Jack.
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
You see!  You see!
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
We seek to undo the curse.
Well done, lad.
Look at that shot!
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
Aye... my Lord...
How're these?
Dolt!
These for me?
You promised!
It's my father, gone a-hunting.
Let's rest a minute.
Oh, dear.
How much longer?
Where are you going?
What happened?
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
I'm afraid it may storm.
Lili!  No!
What have I done?
I thought you were dead... I --
No!  I won't let it happen...
Oh!
Sweet Jack.
What's the matter?
Honored to make your acquaintance.
Step lively now!
Sigurd's sword...
What's this now?
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
This is sad news, be it true.
Courage, Jack.
This is not the time for squabbling.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
What care I for the human heart!
Is this a May Day pageant?
The fastest in the world.
What do we do now?
What's she doing?
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Praise be to God.
Master Jack!
Where?
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Hello, Jack.
Sorry, Jack.
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
How came you by this blade?
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Uhm... fine work.
You're with us in battle.
Is he a friend, then?
Lost?
Simple as that, eh?
Can you show us the way?
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
Marco!
Dad's disappeared!
Are you going to see Sam again?
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
And video games after!
He's not there.
When does George get to come see his house?
What's that for?
He hasn't called?
Do you guys feel like painting?
Mom?
I put him to work.
I couldn't get it to go down.
What are you doing up so early?
Why?  What do you mean?
I'm going to bed.
Atonement.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
He must.
Alyssa.
Don't you have school?
What's today?
My keys.
I had them in my pocket.
Can you keep Sam straight?
You have to ask like that?
Did you feel anything?
My mother would die.
It's not what I was expecting.
I'm hungry!
Hey.
You should stay.
He's a freak.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
Josh and I are going to South Coast.
Huh?
Not really.
Really?
This is serious!
I've seen lots of people.
What's the point of this?
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
I was wondering.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
You hate your father.
I don't wanna go.
Where are you?!
Why is that?
He won't leave my room.
This is such a street of whiners.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
Are you guys' friends?
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Mr. Stevens?
Bob Larson.
I hate to ask about a window.
Mr.
I have the permit.
That would take weeks.
I'm good, thanks.
Right...she married...what was he?
This isn't me.
I've been here twenty years.
Oh.
Class of eighty-six!
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
I've got one favor to ask.
Is Alyssa home?
Sam?
Thanks for the shower.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
Is Alyssa here?
This has got to stop!
I forgot where I put my keys.
Hello?
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
I never said anything.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
Who are you, anyway?
Mom, tell him I'm not going.
I'm not going!
Your nose ring comes out of your nose.
Are you totally insane?!
Probably in the bible.
What are you doing?!
I hate turkey.
I don't know.
No one would blame me if I left!
I don't beg.
I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
Where is it?
I've been using since I was twelve!
I was holding for someone.
I'll have to pay him back.
Do whatever you want with it.
Hi, Alyssa.
I took some of your Vicodin.
I know the feeling.
I wish you had told me then.
Are you talking?
I loved him too much.
You look better than ever.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
And you told Mom today?
We're all dying from the start.
I don't wanna go, Sam.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
What would you do?
What kind of house?
Good for you.
I aimed high.
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
Ah!  Oh....
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
It's my day off.
How many bedrooms will your house have?
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
You should lock your doors.
Lock the door behind you.
What are you doing?
He never answers.
I called everyone, everywhere!
What?
I need to talk to you.
Hey, hey!
What was I supposed to do?
I did say he could go.
George --
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
It makes me sad.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches.
You head was pressed against my chest.
What is it?
It's not breakfast yet.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
With your hands or your tongue?
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
Do you need anything?
Where's Sam?
You brought your kids?
Do you need help?
It's been a while.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
I thought we were helping.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
I'm married.
Let's not do this, okay?
Is your back still killing you?
Back.  Neck.  Back.
I could die.
Are you going to kiss me?
Don't move!
I better get the kids home.
Been thinking?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
He said he heard hammering.
What are you talking about?
What the fuck?
I don't have a clue anymore.
We've eaten.
To shave your chest?
The biggest waste of time since television.
After the kids are back in school.
I'm helping George build his house.
I can't go right now.
I was talking about our marriage.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
You never really trusted me.
Where are the kids?
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
No.
Do it now!
You don't look like you.
Hey.
I've missed you guys.
Do you know anything about building a house?
What are you doing in my room?
There were no PG's.
The door was open.
You're sure about this?
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Queer.
All day again?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
I brought a few of my own.
Adam, that's not true!
Nothing R, okay?
Go tell your father we're eating.
They ain't men, Mae Rose.
A night in the hole?
She'll be fine.
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit.
These are free papers.
It's 1945.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Look, I am truly sorry about this.
Oh, no, Ray.
Yeah.
Damn dentures slipping again.
I apologize, Claude.
Forty years.
You know I trust you, Claude.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Cool it, Ray.
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
I got it... boss.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
Comfortable?
Season tickets to the Yankees.
Engagement ring!
I've never seen you in here before.
Can't you remember your own name?
Claude.
Don't I know you?
Here, this belongs to you.
Where they taking us, anyway?
What are they gonna do to us?
Come on, daddy-o.
What?
How would I get a loan, anyway?
Ah, go chase yourself.
Maybe we oughta find another place.
You mean this sign?
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
I said you're soft.
Alright. You want some pie?
Nice meeting you?
Hey, Ray.
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
What do you think you're doing?
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
Would you look at that, Ray.
Man, this is gonna delay everything.
Life?
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
This fork is filthy.
No, man.
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
What's up, Ray?
No.
You did it, man!
You call this a map?
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Don't mention it.
Keep it together, Claude.
All right, man, just settle down.
We'll just get off at the next stop.
Hundred and Sixty First Street?
Give me back that hot dog.
You want to hit?
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
What about us?
It's a pardon from the governor.
Let it go, Claude.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
My daddy died in prison.
You're a sucker.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
What?!
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy.
What the hell are you doing?
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
You sure it was him?
Don't shoot, sir.
No, I'm gonna kill him --
I can't do it.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning.
I can't eat this.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
No, this ain't gonna work either.
I know you're not talking to me...
How you doin'?
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
What is that?
You got your own nightclub?
Why ain't his pick swinging?
Too hot, huh?
He's from New York City.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain.
All in, boss!
Alright, listen up!
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
So it don't exist.
You mean Louis Armstrong?
That's right, fellas.
Where am I at, man?
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
Hell of a way to get out.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
Man, you really bummed me out.
What do you think about that?
Ray's special recipe.
Mama?
What are you doing here, mama?
I can't take that, mama.
I can't believe this.
Is everyone here?
Wait for the firemen!
Lemonade?
What's going on here?
He's crazy.
Mr.
Yeah, it's getting late.
Must have been some time ago.
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
Apparently, your sister died.
Appreciate it.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me.
Who?
What's your name?
Goldmouth?
What's the Boom Boom Room?
Last night?
Alright Willie, I think I got everything.
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
Man, that music is hot.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
Where'd you get this?
I'm interested. Keep talking.
ADRIAN!
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell.
Of course I can.
Welcome to the party.
Little Nicky.
Now will you get in the flask?
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
That's what I thought!
We could create our own hell there.
Hello, Cassius.
Thank you, Nicky.
No!
Ta-da.
But what about the cash?
It is awfully hot down here.
And give you a good buzz.
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you.
Oh.
I'll call her later.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
She goes to Parson's, right?
Okay, can I just ask you something?
Wow. What... what did she look like?
How come you're not older?
Where did you meet my father?
How did you see me?
Valerie's crying!
I gotta help her.
But how can I win?
What is it?
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.
What's Nicky doing down there?
Did you just talk?
Where is he? He's late.
They castrated him.
My name's Beefy.
Makin' friends already.
So far, so good. Now what?
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
From now on.
You'll be alright.
This is intense!
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
I didn't murder anybody
This is baloney!
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
I'm sorry.
Knock, knock.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Now everybody sit down.
I mean... tough break.
Now that was an experience.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
You're a good devil, Dad.
This is bad, Nicky.
No. This can't be happening.
That's a train, son.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad.
You came through, Nicky.
Listen, I got down low.
Hey.
Bus?
Hey...
Nothing's getting through that.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
I've never been to Earth.
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Easy, Liberace.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
There's our man.
What's with that guy?
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
Look who's back from the dead.
That's a big pass, Elton John.
You sure you're down with this?
Looking for the chief.
Schnapps...
This don't look good.
Which way did he go?
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
Come on. One more time.
No thanks.
Please. You got to.
I'm not Nicky.
Good idea... kill me.
You gotta kill yourself.
Hello.
Adrian?
You got the wrong window again, man.
That was amazing.
Here, have a Popeye's.
It's freezing my hands.
This town is really going to hell lately.
I'd love to have a dog.
You know what's nice about you?
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
Hey.
What were you thinking coming here?
Valerie?
You gotta believe me.
Can we go fly over Central Park?
We're going to Jersey?
Don't do it.
Nicky!
Do me.
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky.
Yes. What is rent?
Why is that funny?
It looks like the work of a brother...
A little strange.
That just hurt a lot.
Hey...
You callin' me a thief, my man?
Okay, now you gone and done it.
I'm a Sandman!
For me?
Fourteen?
Are you too startled?
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
How do you think we got here?
Where do you think we came from?
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
Is that the wind?
Answer the question!
How do you want us?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
How did they get in here?
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
I designed it myself.
Do you have anything special in mind?
You are here.
Had enough?
You need a lift.
Why?
Did you ever see Francis-8?
I don't know what makes you so curious.
You missed something special.
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand.
Who invited you?
That was a great shot you made.
What the hell took you so long?
What's going on, Logan?!
Why did you do that??!!
It's him!
That's right.
What's your name?
What's wrong, Available?
Please... no?
Let's have sex.
What Quad do you live in?
You could have called me yourself.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
You can have any woman in the city.
Why show me?
Where did you get that?
Are you here to help me?
What're you going to do?
If you did know, you'd tell me.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
I'd rather be with you.
They're like beasts. Wild.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
I'm ashamed.
Are you taking me to them?
Exactly four steps now.
Will you take me with you?
How do we know this is the right way?
What do you suppose this was...?
I'm afraid.
What's that?
I hate outside! I hate it!
Don't!
It's getting dark and cold.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
You're right.
What does it mean?
You can have any woman in the city.
I have never seen a face like that before.
They all have names and numbers on them.
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
What are we promising him?
Beloved husband...
What does that water do?
Yes, cats, of course.
And... and how were you grown?
What kind of jewel is this?
What belongs to the people?
We'll have to bury him.
I'll make the arrangements.
Of course.
Come with us.
Goodbye.
Hello, Sandman.
We don't get many Sandmen.
How long have you been living here?
How did you get here?
But there may be a few around somewhere.
Where are they?
They're beautiful.
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
May we stay here for a while?
Are you ready to put him in?
We're leaving.
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
Is that really it?
That's better than gold when it's cold.
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
I don't know who you are.
Someone will follow.
Well? How do you like it?
No -- just there -- on the first level.
You're not contagious are you?
You want somethin'?
What's happenin'?
You okay, man?
Pete... You okay?
I'm, okay... You okay?
Do you always sleep here?
You're a musician?
I like to remember things my own way.
Why not?
Why not?
Very strange.
Do you own a video camera?
No.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
We'll keep a watch on the house.
You don't remember being awakened?
You recognize that guy?
What a fuckin' job.
I was here yesterday.
Where's your phone?
I want more.
Hello.
Pete?
Hello.
He'll kill us.
Have you partied with him?
You like it?
You liked it.
So, should I call Andy?
I'll set it up for tomorrow night.
Set.
Are you my man?
You got him.
You all right?
Alice...
Where's the bathroom?
Andy, who is that guy?
I don't. I don't know him.
Wonderful!
Better.
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
Hey.
You don't look so good.
Sheila?
Never saw him before in my life.
Please tell me.
His condition? What do you mean?
Have you made any charges against him?
Just rest easy, Pete.
Where's Pete?
We saw you that night, Pete.
Repeat that, Bill.
How about Madison?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
You just gonna let him go?
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
That's not Fred Madison?
I wouldn't know how.
I want to see him.
No.
Do you remember?
What's the matter?
We know that.
Who is it?
What is this, Rogoff?
Who is this man?
He's not Madison?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I won't ever tailgate.
That's it.
There's no other bedroom?
What's your axe?
Something wrong?
What's bothering you, Madison?
What is it?
We've met before, haven't we?
Where's Alice?
What's that?
It must be from a real estate agent.
Good book, huh?
I had a dream about you last night...
You're up early.
What's that? Another tape?
Don't you want to watch it?
We've got to call the police.
So?
We will.
What the hell is going on?!
What was that?!!!
No, I don't remember anything.
Where would you feel safe?
I thought you were getting me a drink?
Let's go home.
I told you to stay in the car!
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
Give that a try.
Beautiful!
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
You like pornos?
Suit yourself, champ.
How ya doin', Pete?
Her name is Alice.
Hello.
Mr. Eddy?
You sure you're doin' okay?
I don't think so.
What's goin' on?
I missed you.
What are you guys doin'?
Why haven't you called me?
What's happening to you?
You still care about me?
What else about that night?
What do you want?
Why don't you like me?
Where'd you come from?
I didn't know you cared.
Sheila, what is it?
Hey... Sheila.
Sheila... Stop...
Cable from Gainsford.
All of it?
Conway's gone again!
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
Not even a radio?
What about those men we met this morning?
Two years!?
I beg your pardon, brother.
Sorry.
Good morning, Lovey.
Wait a minute.
He might have lost his way.
Yes.
Left us here to rot.
Where are they? Do you see them?
Mr.
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Yeah?
Some layout they got here.
Don't mind Lovey.
How about you Lovey?
Certainly not.
That's too bad.
Yes.
Yeah. You know.
Hey Lovey, come here!
There you are!
Oh my, isn't that pretty!
Charming chap.
Well, that's that, I guess.
What are we going to do?
That's what I say.
Yes.
Chalmers Bryant!
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
You see?
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Hey, what's happened to you?
Look, honey.
If you want me to!
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
There you are!
And mine's Conway.
Where is your mad pilot?
You will need suitable clothes for the journey.
And the wine - excellent.
That would suit me perfectly.
One moment.
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Charming, isn't she?
What do you want?
Please calm yourself.
Amazing, Mr.
Oh, yes.
A fine trick!
It's all your fault!
You're lying, aren't you?
Are you taking me?
No, I can't!
Sit here, near me.
It's astonishing - and incredible, but
That Conway seemed to belong here.
Bob! I think I hear motors!
The power house - they've blown it up!
All right, go ahead!
Bob, these are all that are left.
Just what I needed too.
Hurray!
Hello, Freshie.
Don't worry, George.
Oh, stop it!
George, what are you going to do?
What are these people?
Oh George, come on.
What is it? Has he fainted?
He's dead.
What is it?
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
George, what do you think you're doing?
George, come back!
Let me up! Let me up!
What about the porters?
George - you're behaving like a child.
I said we're getting out of here.
Something grand and beautiful, George.
George, are you sure of the porters?
You can't take her away from here!
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La?
You say the porters are waiting for us?
Target practice again!
Where did you come from?
Where were you hiding?
No.
Good.
I guess we're in for it.
Huh?
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Oh, please.
Was this your idea?
I'm thirty.
What is?
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Ouch!
Would you like to wring my little neck?
I've thought about it for years.
What do you want him to do?
What is it?
Why, he's speaking English.
That's what I mean - mysterious.
How about you? Do you want to go?
EXCUSE ME
You promised to come for tea yesterday.
The hell happened?
You shot an eight year old girl.
Yes.
So.
...touch that.
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
It's easy.
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
You think we're nuts.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?
So.
Bull.
Look.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Mikey.
Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
I wasn't scared...
Grab the coffee, will ya?
Helluva night, isn't it?
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Dee.
We'll take it from here.
Vayanse. You others, go on.
This is a neurelyser.
Underground gas vein.
Well, how about if I guess, then?
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
It's a bug.
So.
I think she's the alien.
I'm just saying it was cold.
Well, one thing's for sure.
What?
what's this?
Now what?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds.
Something's wrong here.
Looks like a train ticket.
What's going on, Kay?
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
Jesus...
Jesus Christ...
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
Oh, yeah?
Kay--
He's here to help!?
Great.
What are you doing?
Since how long?
Maybe they didn't get here.
We saw it in the office.
It's marble.
Would you call this a code 100?
Wow.
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
You were saying?
After I got the shit beat out of me!
Who's she gonna tell, anyway?
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
Sure.
So... how'd you hear about this?
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
It's hard to find.
When?
What do we do?
Okay.
What are you doing?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
Pardon me.
Not bad.
Goodwill...
Nowhere.
Er. well, nowhere special.
Oh yeah?
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
I know what this is.
Listen to me.
Found it.
I just wanted to scare em.
We're from Scientific American.
This it?
I mean, I dunno.
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Which way?
Really nice wheels, by the way.
How's Dee?
Jupiter, actually.
Kay?  What's your 20?
He's gone, too.
They're gone.
I'm getting a trajectory...
And they're buying it?
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Yeah?  What's up?
How'd you know?
Now, what are we looking at?
Why, you might ask?
Wally!
I'm sorry, but I need your help.
What?
Take it.
Agatha --
Drop some money.
No.  Follow him.
Agatha...
He's here.
I can't.  I have to know.
Oh, God...
Please, I want to go back...
Where are we going?
I always wondered what the world would be like.
Can't you see?
-- but he didn't.
Think, John.
John?  What is it?
Don't worry.
Anesthesia.
That's not much.
You don't remember me, do you?
From where?  D.C.?
I put you away --
There's food in the refrigerator.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
I'm setting up a timer.
You the sentry?
Victim's a white female.
That's an old one.
You the only sentry?
Hence the expression...
Why's he still a John Doe?
You're part of my flock now, John.
Tell me not to worry, John.
I need you to do two things for me.
Lara called me.
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
John --
People want to believe in the system.
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
Seventeen minutes.
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
Don't run, Chief.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
We need confirmation on the time frame.
We can't grab it...
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Somewhere near the capital?
Look at the kid.
Go ahead.
Jad.
Red Ball?
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Confirm with trig and image.
Why did you catch that?
It was Iris Hineman.
To them.
Sorry.
You set me up...
I can't touch you!
They're not in any pain.
She was looking right at me.
She spoke to me.
Wally, listen to me...
Are these all of her previsions?
Just go to the beginning!
Detective.
I'm impressed, Anderton.
Are you reading my mind right now?
She's got information inside of her.
I tell you what.
Stop --
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Rufus, play it back...
I scored a goal!
I won!
Four.
Okay... now let me time you.
Sean -- you're not real.
You're alive?
Who are you?
Six years ago.
Do you know who I am?
... and that I needed his help.
Where've you got him?
It floated back up.
You're not gonna kill me?
But you have to.  They said you would.
You're supposed to kill me.
What about the picture --
Let go of the gun.
Something wrong?
What's so funny?
It began as play.
What?
You want to bring it down.
Where?
How do I even know which one has it?
John?
This is all my fault.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.
It's insanity around here.
Who?
I understand.
The guy from USA Today is here.
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Congratulations, sir.
How did you get this?
You have an emergency call on your private line.
He came to see you yesterday.
Shall we call the Attorney General?
Lamar, I found something.
Good God.  What was that?
He told me about this.
It's the same prevision.
Now the second image.
By fooling the system.
So there is a way to fool the system?
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
Can't they shut that off?
Crime of passion.
Because of the nature of murder.
Don't worry.
Here's where we're at.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
There a maid in this hotel?
I worked homicide before I went federal.
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
John Anderton was my friend!
He looks familiar.
What about your meeting?
We could have lunch together.
Raincheck?
Howard --
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
This your work?
I like it.
I don't have any sugar either.
Since right after we lost our son.
You know I need to use you.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
They've never been separated before.
Hi, uh, excuse me.
He'll be a minute, hon.
Martel's and coke.
So, wait, you're from where?
I don't get it.
Okay.
Will you leave me alone, already...?
Is he cute?
Oh no. What is it this time.
What the fuck was that about?
Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
Ricky's not wearing one.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
What's wrong, baby?
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
You're not my daddy.
Hello.
I gotta go, baby.
Honey?
So, what kind of gig is this?
Oh my god. What happened?
You talk to Max today?
Go finish getting ready.
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
She needs a family.
I never promised you anything.
Take her.
Whu --
I said no touching.
I -- I -- I... Don't...
It's already been a hell of a night.
What's up? Jess ready?
C'mon girl. Eat up.
What's up.
He making the drop?
How bad is it?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
So what do we do?
Now, here's what worries me.
Heard of them.
Where we going?
This is it.
You like the ponies?
I like you, kid.
Yeah. Sure.
Yes, for expenses and such.
Yes.
There won't be a next thing.
That's him.
'Dis?
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me.
A bad heart.
What's the plan?
Now listen.
Hi.
What's that?
Where is the Soho Grand?
I can wait around if you want.
Spa?
'Trustafarians?'
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
We're with Ruiz.
Sorry, man, but...
Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
Come on, man.
We need guns.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
Sorry coach.
We look good this year.
Nice work.
No, man.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
What? Did she say something?
Right here's fine.
It's ours.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
You hear that?
Shit.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Who you calling?
What are you doing?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
Shit.
What exactly did they say?
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
You know this guy?
This shit's sketchy.
So is this the drop?
Yeah.
You happy?
Where do you think you're going?
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
What the fuck's going on?
What the hell did you do?
What the fuck was that about?
Hi.
What are you doing.
Put that shit out...
Nothing, man.
Let's do it.
Let's check out the penguins.
We need guns.
Calm down.
Look.
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
Dude, we were practically made...
Hey, boys.
C'mon...
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
Where's the surprise?
You want to come splash around.
I want to leave right now.
Watch out, man.
Cardiff Giant?
Did you see that shit?
What's up, man.
Yes?
Yes?
Yes.
Where's Spa.
How do you know it's not drugs?
Don't drag my ass into this --
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
See you later.
Ow, shit...
I'm half Irish.
And where is...?
No shit?
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
What do you want?
Sorry, mates.
Here they are, then.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Yeah.
Good morning.
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
Ricky.
Is it nice?
So whenever we want...
A lot of Persians?
I call 'em wiggers.
Sure. You boys want anything?
Nigger, please.
Can I borrow a piece of --
Yeah.
I get it.
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
No. I'll take a strega.
We don't know any drill.
What the fuck was you told?
No...
Who's gonna outfit us?
The Red Dragon.
Yeah.
Well, that's news to me.
Dip?
I'll get it.
Sit down.
What they call you?
I'm working trains. Selling.
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
Is your papa West Indian?
Where can I get a hold of you?
Don't never write nothing down.
Did you just now con me?
I like your heart and I like your style.
You looking good, Little.
How's it feel?
I told you less paper, less trouble.
It hit?
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
Daddy, where's my money?
Shit, what else she gonna say?
Oh, sit down, man.
You're a damn liar.
And every cat's watching, ain't they?
Take it easy, baby.
You saved my life, Archie.
Man live by his rep.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
Who the hell are you?
You ain't lying.
Putting all that poison in your hair.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
The question is, who are you?
What you sniffing around for?
Come on, daddy, pull my coat.
I can't make out that shit.
That's bullshit.
Aardvark, noun.
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
Little.
The body is a holy repository.
I will do it.
I can't.
Yeah.
What can I do for you?
Do you?
I'll have it tomorrow.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Is the program ready?
Make it plain.
What?
Sure I'll speak to your class.
Women talk too much.
What points?
I see your point.
Could we sit down someplace?
Let's talk about you for a change.
I'm in Detroit.
It won't be easy.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I don't want to bring my troubles home.
No, what's the matter with you?
Dear heart, you have to help me.
Get some sleep.
I'm sorry.
Stop calling us.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us.
Brother Earl.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Why don't you just ask your question?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Now just a moment, just a moment --
Mr.
Stop me if I'm wrong.
Let him finish.
If you want to tell me.
If I surprise you, let me explain.
Did you see the papers today?
Can I ask you something?
You know that gal?
She know?
Is she hooking?
The average first offender gets two years for burglary.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
I better not come in.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want.
Let's go.
It's the same questions, Mrs.
How many you turning out?
Another one?
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
That's alright.
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
You the man.
You evil this morning.
Yeah, girl; that's your story.
You had the number.
Well, all right, then.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
That's a fine chick.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
That ain't bad.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
I got to hand it to you, Homey.
You want to be the head man?
Your turn, Rudy.
I'm Minister Malcolm X.
Who the hell are they?
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
Brother Minister he often talked about you.
We were parceled out, all five of us.
What am I doing here?
You have a rather checkered past.
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen.
Hombre en fuego.
My family lives in Miami.
My country needs justice.
[Where are you coming from?]
[Senor?]
A lot of people are looking for you.
It's Santa Muerte.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
Where do I find you?
What do you know about the cop?
I traced the PIN.
[Reina Rosas.]
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[What is his name?]
[How does it work?]
[Who pays you?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[What money?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[Drive.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[The Ramos kidnapping.
[I don't know!
[I don't know, I swear.]
Who's he?
[Hello Daniel.
[How much do you want?]
[The most important thing in life is family.
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[Do you know who I am?
[Please, don't...]
[I don't know him.
[Yes. Many times.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
[That's all I know!
Were you provided with a gun?
What is it?
Is it loaded?
Your resume is impressive.
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
So what's wrong?
So how's business?
Yeah, right...
You been working?
You did something on impulse?
Your Spanish is good enough.
It's not exactly a scam, Crease.
What are you doing here?
You mean a misfire?
Creasy?
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Fuck.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Cut the stock here.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
That's 'Bird.
Where are you from, Creasy?
No.
Potential? I don't understand.
We're taking a different way home.
Did you like school, Creasy?
Hmmm?
And don't start crying.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
You're fast.
What are you doing?
They'll be back in a week.
It hurts.
I don't think they're broken.
Do you always sleep with him?
Did you sleep alright?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
Why do you ask?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
You're late.
Where's my mother?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
I'm tough, Creasy.
What's so important in Los Angeles?
The blocks.
Could I ask you a question?
Pinta, we've got to go.
That's strange.
The world of our children. How dare they?
You've done much of this work before?
How are you getting along with Pinta?
Look.
It makes it all seem so serious.
Sorry.
Jordan!
Why are you here?
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
I don't believe you.
Creasy... Wait.
Rosanna Guerrero.
Of course I care about Pinta.
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
You need a bodyguard of some description.
And Lisa will be able to save face.
[You have the money.]
You should be sleeping, baby.
Good news. You're going back to school.
Could he speak English?
Yes, mom?
I like him, Mom.
I think he's been sick.
Bye, Mom.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
Our child's safety is at stake.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
He has experience in related work.
I think it's nice he's American.
She likes him.
He has to go, Samuel.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
It will be a hard break.
[Because he's outside.
[I know this. Your point?]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[Is it true?
[You only fuck me to get information.]
[Who's that?]
He's not a cop killer.
Pollo Pibil.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
None of your business.

Hail to the chief!
Never mind. Forget it.
When will he be able to write?
Never heard of him.
How come nobody knows about him?
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Don't try to get it far down.
Me, too.
Henry's got our orders!
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
Hell, man, that don't matter.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
Frank...
Wait a second...
Is that liquor?
Give us this day our daily...
I was just asking...
The hell we won't!
Gimme three.
Pierce!
And there it is.
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.

I think I've seen this nut somewhere.
What are they peeking at?
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Black capsule.
We're throwing him a Last Supper.
Or you can let him knock himself out.
We stand behind all our work.
Very well, Your Majesty.
I came within about ten yards of you.
Let me translate.
Look.
Don't worry, son.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Please!
Come on, Trapper.
Is he out?
For you, Trapper.
It's in pretty deep.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
I don't feel anything.
I can't feel it now either.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour.
He only lasted one season.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
The bastards outconned us.
What's the matter?
See you.
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor?
Thank you, Captain Pierce.
Even if I weren't.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal?
You're asking for somebody else?
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
The real Trapper John?
You don't go after the local scrunch?

Why can't you look at him?
He's coming to.
Glad to know you.
Painless, you mustn't talk that way.
That's really what I came here for.
In the direction you want to go.
How much time do I have?
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.

Pain bad, Ho-Jon?

The blonde dish.
You don't aim to cause any trouble  But?
About that chest-cutter...
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry.
First decent idea you've had in a month.
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers.
It's a nice idea.
What's going on? Who started this?
If you say so, Henry.
What's wrong with you?
O'Reilly!
O'Reilly, what is it?
Sir?
Good morning, Colonel.

Huh?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Action?

Yeah.
Now, look, John.
Who?
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Hello, John.
Look, John.

Do you care if I sit down out here?
Ted Sheldon.

Really?
The Old Guy?
What?!
Manual or automatic?
Who are you again?
Hold on a second here.
You signed out twice.
Hi, Roper.
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened.
We got a guy who's probably on drugs.
Anything on Korda so far?
What do you got on Korda?
You don't have to come here.
Alright, Roper.
Are you in charge, Roper?
I want a plane waiting at the airport.
Joe, I'm doing a lot for you.
You can't kill me like this.
Open your shirt.
Satisfied?
It's all there.
I'm impressed.
Same here.
Don't go reading my lips, man.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
It rarely has to be done.
What's the point of this?
I'm sorry about your friend.
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
You got a girlfriend?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
That's a lot of commitment.
You think you can learn, McCall?
Tell me what you need.
I can't do that.
You know the ten commandments?
You tell me.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
What did you see?
Why did he do it?
You know why I like the track?
See the favorite?

There's your answer. He's smart.
He's got the girl.
What the fuck is going on.
How many have you lost?
He's gonna kill her no matter what.
McCall, you all right?
Roper.
Have you evacuated anyone?
I know how you feel, Ray.
I can't leave, Ray.
Same thing happened to me, man.
You know what I think?
Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
Please. I'm begging you.
Hey.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
That a new picture?
I won't stay long.
Oh, hell, forget it.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
It's already started.
What do you think?
What about Greg?
How's Paco doing?
You like this place?
There is?

This is Halden.
There are two million people in there with you.
God-Damn you!
System's running on auxiliary.
It's okay.
Why?
She said I have a son...
How come I can't remember?
That's a strange question.
Your life that bad?
Do you believe in miracles?
You were right.
Who are you?!
It's all here...
The guests are here.
But this is impossible.
What's happening?
It's time to wake up.
But what would happen to me?
Divinity?
You were the one who was dying.
You sealed off the system.
Unlimited energy out there.
Where the hell are you going?
You sure he's going to come?
How long 'till we can eject?
Have communications contact all interface centers.
The maze has been changed --
Where you plugged-in from?
What?
What's her name?
Take care.
He had keys.
Get some internal police there.
Doesn't make sense.
Two maze runners.
Won't be time if he gets access --
He had access to the keys --
You're jumping to conclusions.
Try harder.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
One condition.
What is it?
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
Who did he digitize?
What did he tell you?
Then you had her killed.
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
An interface attendant.
Need the disk back!
What brings you inside?
I've got to get back.
Someone you have to get back to?
You went to my high-school?
Most nights you wake up crying.
We worked together on the inside.
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
You said we were on the same programming team.
Why?
And it meant something.
What?
I wasn't with you.
I'm sorry.
Don't know what you're talking about.
What's so funny?
It was just there.
Don't know what you're talking about.

Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
Here you go!  No pushing!
There goes the neighborhood.
SKULL!!
And how do we do that?
It's... an eagle?
And how do we release the power?
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
Hey, boss!
Just shut your gap!
I'm outta here.
GET OFF ME!
Taking over the world is one thing.
But boss, what about their parents?
Simon says...
What!
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
That's right.
"Basically".
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
What is THAT!
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!

That was a CHEAP shot!
Anybody see them?
How the heck?!...
I am the mighty ape!
THREE SECONDS!!
NINJA APE ZORD!
There seems to be some confusion about your registration.
You own a hotel, sir?
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense.
We're asking you to go to prison.
So Chicago's been good to ya.
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
I remember reading a poem in college.
We have a commission.
Up here, Boss.
Are you frightened?
I had everything. Once.
When my money moves, I go with it.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
I ain't mad.
I got my partner in there!
Four-twenty-eight.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
We could lose the deal!
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Bastard didn't even show.
Masseria's confused.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
You ain't even a man yet.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
The deal's too good, Frankie
A hundred-seven bucks too much.
Well...
Inside, they were talking of you.
You here with Bobby?
What's the matter?
Come on.
Luciano.
You could have stopped him.
I booked passage to London.
If I look weak now, it's over.
Would it be painful for you?
Charlie?
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
Charlie!
Come on, Charlie.
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
You fellas got names?
Meyer just finished the books.
We'll figure out something.
At least Masseria plays by the rules.
Meyer.
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
Like Don Maranzano.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
You're getting' 10 cc's
You bastards, I said twenty!
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
Come off it, Bugs.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
What you mean?
We're gonna change it, Bugs.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
I like that.
I'm glad ya come.
You boys carryin' pieces?
This business is about taking risks.
Where we headed?
What are ya thinkin'?
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us.
We gotta talk in private.
Ya did good.
Sure.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
Salvatore.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him.
And how many soldiers do you have?
He's an animal!
The Internal Revenue came to my offices.
We combine everything.
Tell me, my son.
Conditions have changed.
At first, it will hurt you.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Tell it to the Calabrian.
Forget it. That's past.
Strategy.
Bring order out of chaos.
Know somethin'?
Those fucks can't leave each other alone.
Where's the stiff?
Sorry, Charlie.
Forget it.
Johnson's still on board.
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Maranzano wants you dead.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie.
I'm a hard guy.
Yes?
What a cozy little scene.
Jeez, Bugsy.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Take any one ya like.
You're fuckin' crazy.
Now don't pick a fight.
Special occasion?
Who did this?
Monkeybone?
What's the maximum safe dose?
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Yeah, I know - Picasso.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
Hey, Stu, why so glum?
You're mad at me.
DEATH!!
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
At the moment, yes.
Three months.
What's the matter?
Oh, here's something.
You're really gonna pop the question?
Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute.
Go?
Herb, it's too much.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
So here's my idea.
Holy shit.
No.
The Nightmare Juice!
Wait a minute.
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Land of Death. How do I get there?
NO!
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time.
Easy, pal!
Meaning me, of course.
Bitchin' good cake.
What are you watching?
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Priceless!
What's this about merchandising?
Stu?
We'll hop a plane tonight.
Boy, the nuts are out tonight.
You want to leave?
Look at this!
I'm fine, baby.
Stu?
How was it? I don't recall.
Oh, Stu.
What's the matter?
Kimmy! What's the matter?
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Hypnos?
I'm so sorry, Stu.
Don't ask where I got it.
Go.
You are too!
My Fellow Americans.
Come on, pal!
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
I left my phone number in your undies.
He's ninety.
Y'call that art?
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
I'm so dumb!
Fate worse than death!
Hey.
You gotta talk me into it.
Where'd he go??
Stu...Stu...
Stu...LOOK!
You saved my life, Monkeybone.
Awwww.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Excuse me, sir.
Who told you we deal drugs?
Is there something else I can do for you?
So, what do you think?
I wanted to ask you something.
Don, this is my mother.
Mother, I ...
What's wrong?
Mom, I need to talk to you.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
Here you go.
I love you, Mom.
Who is it?
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
I wonder what they do in there?
Where to?
This is one-way street.
I see.  How much?
Here you are, Senator.
Yes, sir--big as life.
What's he bringing pigeons for?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
Sure.
How do you *like* this!
Tell me why!
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Will you go chase an ambulance!
Sit tight, Diz.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
The Silver Knight.
Did you like the first act?
Why do I always laugh at that?
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
He's cooked!
The war's on!
Diz!
I knew it!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
Dinner, Hubert.
Nonsense.
I do *not* want a Senator.
Otis!
Emma!
Are you ready for him, Bill?
Terrific!
He's batty!
Oh--oh.
One minute! Just one minute!
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
What!
Boy Ranger!
Thanks, Governor--*yes*!
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
What's the matter, Dad?
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
I did. What about it?
"Boy Stuff.
No, *sir*!
A dirty frame!
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
A pet shop?
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
Washington!
Here they are--I got them.
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
Where were you?
Mr. President!
Will the Senator yield?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Well--goodnight.
Y-yes.
Yield *how*, sir?
Will the Senator--
Mr. President! A point of order!
Mr. President--
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Please, sir!--come with me!
Good evening, sir.
Oh, now--
Jerry!
Now, Amos, now--  What?
Hello, Jefferson.
Well.
Can't you?
What is it?
What's your name?
Is--is something the matter?
Gee, I'm sorry.
Whose statue is that?
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Go ahead--punch.
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders.
On paper?
You mean--here?
Uh--Willet Creek.
What do they--?
Yes--right here.
I know.
Hello.
No.
What are you going to do?
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff.
Yay!
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
Tell us about yourself, Senator!
Ah! That's more like it! What?
*Gentlemen*!
Whoa!
Sure.
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?
I don't understand, sir!
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
Order, gentlemen!
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
Ax?
Marvelous!
Yeah!
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
What does he want to--?
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Chick--
Eleven B Street, Northeast.
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
Joe! You *told* him to!
Did I hear right?
--amazing coincidence!
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy!
Who?
What do I *mean*, huh?
You want to see me, Senator?
What do you want, Senator?
Every word that boy said is the truth!
Wait a minute, boys.
That's him. Let him in.
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
Jim!
It's in your lap, Joe.
Hey--Joe!
How nice.
His first 'whiff'!
Father--oh.
Mr. President...
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Will the Senator yield?
Senator Paine will state it!
Order!
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
No.
That's going to be fun.
Put that away, slug!  At your service!
Good morning.
We'd like to get in touch with him.
Since he was born.
Most every day.
They think he's pixilated.
Pixilated.
For no reason, I guess.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
Oh, yes.
He's still pixilated.
Are you married?
No. Are you?
I don't mind though.
It's obviously a frameup!
Thank you, Your Honor.
You are under oath, Miss Bennett.
Oh, thank you!
Your Honor, this is absurd.
You fainted.
No, thank you.
Feel better now?
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
There's just one thing more.
Sure. I met you.
Have you seen the papers?
There you are.
There's Times Square.
Here's a nice place.
Oh, I don't know.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
I've often thought about going back.
He played in the town band, too.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Couldn't sleep.
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Ready?
Mary, I'm going home.
Well, here we are again.
Would you like to read it?
Hello, Mary?
What's the matter, hon?
What's up, Babe?
You haven't gotten very far, have you?
Good night.
You're a fool, Babe.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Why there she is!
Look, I can do it!
Now you're talking, Babe.
Cinderella Man!
He's the original.
How'd you get the picture?
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
What's bothering you, huh?
What're you going to do?
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs.
This is for you , Mac.
It's for you.
Come on, come on!
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
We've got nothing to worry about.
I know, Budington.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Cobb's right.
You try it.
How's it going? Okay?
Stuff, sir?
Sit over there, will you?
How is this, sir?
You can't come up here!
Thank heaven.
Come on, John. What happened?
Relatives of old man Semple.
Miss Bennett please!
Must we have the echo?
He's what?
Your Honor, I object.
It's a lie!
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Newspaperman?
That's pretty.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
I can understand that.
I can't find him.
Look!
Yes?
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Mr.
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Saving a lady in distress, eh?
Will you have a cigar?
I wouldn't worry if I were you.
It's merely a suggestion.
Why not? Who is he?
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Come in, please.
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Have a drink?
You'd better get right down there.
Gee, I'm busy.
I can't hold out on you any longer.
Well, how about tonight?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards?
I don't remember.
Just as I suspected, wise guy!
She's the star reporter on The Mail.
You shouldn't be running away like this.
What about your knocking off for lunch?
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
I'm Chairman?
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
You see, Mr.
We provide opera.
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
The wrong kind!
Now, where were we?
Let him alone.
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you.
Here's the order for the plows.
Mrs. Semple?
I leave it to you, Mr.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Well, I don't know. I
Yes.
No.
Look, he's temperamental.
Your Honor
Proceed.
A what?
Mr.
Now about the Falkner sisters.
Mr.
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Uh-huh.
Brookfield just came in.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness.
That ought to be fun.
Who are they?
New mouthpiece.
How about lunch?
No, he's too fussy for that.
Hear what he said?
What is your name?
You mean  by the neck or something?
Goodnight.
Tails tonight, sir?
What do you think you're doing?
No, sir.
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Mr.
Yes, sir.
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
What do you mean?
You came home last night - without them.
Please!
Yes, sir.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Hey, did you hear that?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Yes, sir.
Pack my things, Walter.
Shall I call the police, sir?
What do they want from me?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
We argued on Sunday.
You can go out there if you like...
Dr. Mumford.
I know I shoulda come to your office.
I'm not sure she'll come.
Hello, Mr.
Better make yourself comfortable.
What an asshole!
Thank you.
But they're certainly dead.
Phyllis, I'm sorry.
Dr.
What are you doing for lunch?
I've run on.
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
We're interested in any new therapies.
...I won't go into that today.
I see.
I have eighteen more minutes!
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
What?
Where's your wife, Henry?
We got divorced.
I was... never satisfied.
What's that?
What is it?
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
I feel like we're making real progress here.
I didn't see you there.
What brought this on?
You must be Dr.
I think you'll like this.
We've done.
You're the doctor, what do you think?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
You're early.
How long you been in this town?
You know who that is, don't you?
So, what makes you so popular?
How ya doin', Ainge?
Do we run into the street?
And the Brocketts?
They come through a few times each year.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip.
...so rich?
Doc...
What it might take is... doing time.
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
Hello, Lionel.
It's a country club.
But you know how to drive?
What's wrong with her?
Hiya, Doc.
How are you?
Hello, Mother.
What's happening here?
It'll never happen!
Ph.D., psychologist.
What'd you want?
Finally, some common sense...
Well... you see, the problem is --
Wow. You're something.
Well, look who's here...
Sofie.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
What can you tell me about this?
When did you start to feel this way?
What?
That's okay.
We'll take it slow.
You have the best answer for everything.
I'm not making any promises.
Mom's such a cutie.
Please... forgive me.
Is this the treatment?
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
Sore throat?
Painful lymph glands?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
I can give myself a headache instantly.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
You're doing great.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
Is that when you split up?
So whose route is this?
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
I need to talk to you.
Is it something you've heard about me?
Hello?
Mother...
I guess you saw the show...?
...How violated I feel?
You feel violated?
I am irate!
Oh.
You got off easy.
The school board doesn't pay you?
I knew you wouldn't answer.
Isn't she amazing?
What are you doing?
There's this kid at school.
What did he want you to do?
...What balls on this guy?
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
Would you like another beer?
Can I ask you a personal question?
I gotta pee.
This is great!
What?
Pretty good, too.
Hey, Skip.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?
Hey, maybe that's all right!
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
Slash what?
How's it coming?
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Who else knows?
Damn! What is your name?
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
"Get to know your therapist."
At least you pulled yourself out...
And the drugs?
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
What about it?
And a birth certificate is enough?
But you studied psychology, right?
Where ya going?
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
Lily.
Sorry...
I'm here for you, Doc.
Doc!
Hmm.
Forgive me, please.
It's possible.
That was a terrible thing.
Yes... your particular approach.
You know where he's taking her?
Who the hell are these guys?
I never killed a priest before.
We saved him!
And what ritual would that be?
Personally, I would like to surrender.
Now go find me a big stick.
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
My very good friend! What a surprise.
Let's make us even, shall we?
O'Connell!
Hey O'Connell!
Goin' somewhere?
C'mon, friend.
Where's your new friend?
Then you got no excuse for living.
The book!
What just happened?
Yeah?
...and how do you say?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
She is like all the others.
The key!
Okay, let's cut to the chase.
See!
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
The sun turning black.
You bastards!
The hell with that!
The hell with this.
And what is he in prison for?
Where are they taking him?
No women allowed.
You lie.
A bright good morning to all.
So who's the broad?
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
Yeah, I was there.
Could you tell me how to get there?
Yes.
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
Did I miss something?
Evil.
You know your history.
Relax!
Can you swim?
We're almost there.
For what?
That "thing" gets me excited.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
There's some sort of lock here.
A key!
You two!
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
No... Why?... Should I?
Is he supposed to look like that?
No we are not.
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
He's here!
You called me your girl?
Got it!
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Got guts, lady.
You...! YOU...!
Have you no respect for the dead?
Oh yes I do!
Jonathan?
Two questions.
Yes.
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Do you really think he'll show up?
It's called mummification.
What do you suppose killed him?
Juicy?
I found it, Evy! I found it
What do I do, Evy!
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
She's my sister, actually.
Hey,... don't I know you?
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
That thing gives me the creeps.
None taken.
Tough break.
Where's my gun?
You did not!
Did you see that!
Who's here!?
That looked rather painful.
Damn-it!
Believe it, sister.
What?
We gotta get her back.
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
I knew you'd come.
The jig is up, Casanova.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
Where are you going?
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
I thought you were done?
Our guests are waiting.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
The Bowler?
We didn't think this through very well.
He was the last time I saw him.
Much less go outside.
We could really use some coffee --
Come on, baby!
Atta, girl!
Hey, do I look like a Man?
Who are you?
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
How about... the Savage Six?
But she's your mother.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
No one will believe us.
Sounds good to me.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
Hey... you okay?
Eat your mustard.
Yes!
Doc, these are my friends.
Snap out of it!
He'll never make it.
I hope you enjoy these cigars.
Superheroes.
That boy's got talent.
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
And the light goes out...
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Are you an actress?
Hi.
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Who's the artist?
Come here.
I'd better go.
Stay away!
Or talk?
Hi.
I admire you.
Me too.
You know what?
It's me.
At the Frankenstein Center.
So, let me get this straight.
You're the Sphinx.
But now Casanova's back!
You drink too much.
Maybe.
We're all the same really.
Oh don't start that again --
Leave him alone.
What are you talking about?
And it would be the right thing to do.
I'm liking this.
Have you ever seen him?
You sure that's how you spell it?
There's just not enough of us.
There's a big difference.
You know something?
So what else has Superman got?
This place is built like a fortress.
GET MAD!
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
But she still might call!
Cover me!
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
He's Lance Hunt!
We need a break, that's all!
Nah.
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
Let's go.
The who?
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
Maybe she's right.
Agents?
Sounds good.
Maybe there was traffic.
Roy --
So where's the art?
What's that?
He's turned into a completely normal person!
But... only when no one is looking.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
The Obliterators!
Firepower costs money.
Yes, Obie-wan.
You guys going to a costume party?
Are you famous?
Really?
Here you go. 
Jeffrey!
It's on the television.
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry.
Oh, who gives a damn who he is?
Hi.
She likes you.
This is bad.
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Don't crunch the leaves.
Be a Mohican.
Do we have to?
And there's the Sphinx.
And a social life.
To us!
Are you sure he's still lives here?
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
That was too close.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
Oh no.
It's time.
We've got lift off!
Where am I going?
What do you think Napoleon will do?
Yes -- who spoke up?
Yes, Captain?
Well, Belliard, what's this?
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable!
But did she have the best doctors?
Who is there?
Read it back.
General Bonaparte?
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Yes, sir?
I haven't been there for three years.
Just a minute, General.
Hello there, Picart.
My God...!  What time is it?
When did it start?
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Thank you, Napoleon.
No -- not as a rule.
Good evening, sir.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
What's your name?
I would like both of you to read this.
No... nothing at all.
The important thing is to find the right lawyer.
Will you use the troops?
Were you in love with him?
Promise me you will never leave me.
Yes -- what is it?
Separate bedrooms?
Who is it?
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
I believe you sent for me.
What the hell is the matter with you?
You could hear them?
You mean you heard them making love?
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
Good day, monsieur.
Good evening, ladies.
And, where did you see my portrait?
Do you like music?
Good day to our brothers-in-arms.
What did you say his name was?
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
I know Alexander.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Send Betty my love.
It's cool, but where's the water?
That's okay, Unc.
I know you smoke weed, right?
No.  Thought he was with you.
Me, too.
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
Stretch it out.
Who are you?
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
Where you going?
No I'm not.
Great moves, Day-Day.
What you mean talk to her?
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
What's the green stuff poking out?
Sorry, bro, reflexes.
Me neither.
It's about to work, just come on.
Dude, dogs hate me.
I ain't trying to rob you...
Shut up.
What's crackin'?
Yep.
Who is that?
This you?
Man, this a cool house.
Go on and make yourself at home.
I can't see!
She pepper-sprayed me, man!
You straight?
Just a little.
Who is that?
So.
I walked.
You know what this is?
How can they do this?
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
$247.
What's the matter?
I ain't trying to get in it.
You better stop running from that girl.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
Blow.
It works.
This vacuum don't work.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
What we gonna do?
Alright, Roach, see you around.
You see that?
Yeah, air.
You make it sound so easy.
You go first.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
Wait.
What you see?
You're welcome, Unc.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
Karla.
You want us to give you a ride?
Hello, remember me?
Most definitely.
Huh?
You did all this for me?
I did.  Is that door locked?
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Next time, page me first.
You alright?
Delivery!
Delivery!
Can I help you?
What is it?
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
Here I come!
What's the matter?
I gotta get'em fixed.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
You coming in?
Craig, remember what I told you.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.
You see that?
Two bullets?
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
You too.
My name is Miss Ho Kym.
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
What kind of activity?
See you later, Day-Day.
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
I can't get jiggy with this shit.
No, give me my damn money back.
Did you see that?
Craig, this Roach.
What it say?
What is it?
That the big one, huh?
What was that?
Are they still out there?
Today ain't my day.
I do.
Roach, what are you doing?
I don't know.
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
Try an' hold it, man.
Roach...Roach, come on.
You wanna knock?
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.
Hey.
What?!  What that mean?
Money?
Get 'em, Craig!
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Wet your eyes, boy.
Ah damn.  Damn.
Where's Craig?
What the fuck you looking at?
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Why would he take it?
Tape his mouth shut.
Where did Craig move to?
What you say?
Get on.
Here's the plan.
Just do it.
William.
You too big.
Debo!  Debo!
Ezal!  Ezal!
Hey, how you get out of here.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
Hey, what's going on?
Make sure you look after my son out here.
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
What about that ugly dog?
Need to lose some weight.
Damn, big bro.
My back.
Well, we better hit the road, too.
Okay, okay, that's enough.
Huh?
Mr. Nasty time?
Elroy, what happen?
Lousy.
During a campaign every speech is important.
Don't remind me.
All right, I'll do it.
Aw, gee.
Where to, sir?
Amtrack?
Where'd you come from?
Somebody close?
I need your help.
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
I remember you...in the elevator.
How do you know that?
You shot her?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
This? I've never even fired one.
Can we go now?
Good luck.
Could I see some identification, sir?
Is this about those kids?
Come with us, sir.
Hey!
Daddy?
Pay attention, Mr.
Yes, yes, I understand.
This is for you.
You're out of your mind.
Look at your watch.
This says "invitation only".
This'11 get you in anywhere.
Are you 'fucking with me!?
You get another chance in ten minutes.
What would you do in my place?
What...?
You killed him.
I killed you.
How am I supposed to get away?
Come back.
Again.
One thirty. California Ballroom.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
Is that something precious?
I don't know.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie.
Are you sure?
I think you better put that away.
Who is this?
We have to hurry.
I'm serious, honey.
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
So, come on.
Ready?
Lynn!
He has to say "over and out".
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
Can we go now?
No, honey, not to be a hero.
Will you promise me that?
I have to do something.
You got anything smaller?
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
You remember me?
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
My daughter.
Then why'd you drag me into it?
It's about time I did.
Keep the change.
Meet Irene.
What am I supposed to say to her?
Well?
What are you going to do!?
Thanks for the shine.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield.
Hey!
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
Well, is it real?
You stole that.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car?
This is what they call the jack.
He's going to help the police.
That's pretty good.
Where are we going?
I'm not a baby.
Close your eyes.
You got this under control?
It's under control.
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Get moving.
That one.
I'm looking for them.
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
Foreigners! Fuck!
And what happens if I don't call you?
God can't help her, Mr.
That's enough.
Yeah.
Come Back.
Any trouble?
He never told about the money.
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
Think of it, Ben!
Where's your Mom?
Here they come.
Listen to me son.
You got common sense.
O, she's all right.
Leavin', boy?
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
Uncle Birdie!
Here's what you owe me.
I'll light the lamp.
Where's Ruby?
AAA-MENN!
And the Lord told that man --
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Plan on a longer visit next time.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
What's wrong, Mother?
Who?
Just went?
Is he hit pretty bad?
What can we do, Mother?
Lynch him! Lynch him!
He lied!
You go set down by the River.
My, that fudge smells yummy!
Amen! Amen!
My dear, dear friends!
What could have possessed that girl!
I burned it.
Ain't no sense in it, neither.
I tried to save her.
Just look at you!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Hing, hang, hung.
Tell me a story, John.
Just a man.
John...
Now can I tell?
You swore, Pearl!
You'll get awful mad, John.
Pearl! You ain't --
It's all here.
Where's Mom?
Someone is after us, Pearl.
Where are we goin', John?
I'm hungry, John.
John?
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Are we goin' home, John?
Don't you hurt her!
John, where's your folks?
Where ye from?
Story, honey? Why, what story?
I'll see to Pearl.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Did you hear what I said, son?
Tell me what, boy?
What are you doing, boy?
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy.
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
All right boy: where's the money?
All right...  Come along.
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Now where, boy?
Now: Where?
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Nothin'. 
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
Sure, that's no secret.
You see?
Yes; John's bad.
O no! Your turn!
John's bad.
I'm hungry.
About our secrets.
What's their names?
Mister Powell?
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
Didn't you have no inkling?
What do you figure to do?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
Harry!
Get up, Willa.
Do you want more children, Willa?
Are you through praying?
You were listening outside the parlor window.
Mornin', ladies.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
She run off with a drummer one night.
Gracious, gracious!
The Lord is merciful!
What's wrong, John?
What do you want?
Pearl and John!
I been bad!
This gentleman warn't like them!
What'd you all talk about?
Miz Cooper!
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses?
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma.
They're just simple tests, Nan.
How long's this been going on?
Okay, good. She's asleep.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
How can you tell?
Oh my god, oh my god...
Worked like a charm.
It's just a stupid cat.
So we'll guard her together.
What the hell's going on!?
You okay?
Guess I did.
M'god, I look twenty years old.
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
Okay?
Jesus, it's dark in here.
Yeah. So?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Hello?
Much better.
Me!
Bring him out of what?
How you doing, pal?
Rod's not a lunatic.
She dreamed this would happen...
You used me, daddy!
Decide to take a day off after all?
Only family allowed, Nancy.
Dad -- what you doing here?
Hello Nancy.
I've got a proposition for you.
Sure, okay, I'll be there.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
What's the Coroner got to say?
Looks like her boyfriend did it.
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Get outside and watch her house.
Who? Who did that?
Had to've done it.
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Apparently he was crazy jealous.
Where you think you're going?
Did you sleep?
Right home after.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
What?
You okay?
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
I must be going nuts...
You okay?
Go even crazier?
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Screw sleep!
What's with the bars?
Your father the cop.
Give me the key, mother.
Guess I should'n'a done it.
Feeling better?
We got her mother's bed.
I never touched her.
Someone else was there.
And then what happened?
No.
What you mean 'all at once'?
Do you think I did it?
Rod says the sweetest things.
Nice to have a fire.
What you dream?
What the hell you doing here?
You feel better now, right?
When did you have a nightmare?
Thank you, Comrade.
Well, here are fifty francs.
What is it, Ninotchka?
From Leon.
Good evening, Anna.
They didn't let me.
I'll tell you later.
No, I left everything in Paris.
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades?
Comrades!
You wouldn't like Razinin.
And how is Lord Lavenham?
Are we free, Buljanoff?
No, that's not him...
That's her.
Can you blame them?
It is, Ninotchka!
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
Capitalistic methods...
He's cutting our throat...
We don't like Razinin.
Misha! Misha!
That must be the one!
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
What a lovely room you have here.
We can say whatever we want.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
How are things in Moscow?
Which lawyer?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Let's not close our eyes.
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Guest?
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
About this telegram to Moscow.
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Good morning, Your Highness.
Nonsense.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Good evening, Gaston.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Your breakfast, monsieur.
What time have you, Gaston?
Your Highness...
Good evening, Your Highness.
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
Is this satisfactory?
Comrades, why should we lie to each other?
We can wait.
We can call our ambassador.
That won't help you!
Yes, Leon...
Leon, my little boy.
Halt negotiations immediately.
This is a fine thing.
Let's do that.
Well, I think it's getting late.
That was our idea when we first came.
Don't call it desertion.
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
We don't want to be disturbed.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
What proposition?
And if we have to go to Siberia...
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites.
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade Buljanoff...
How much does this cost?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Only myself and two other girls.
Bad news?
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
Yes, monsieur?
This is Comrade Kopalski.
I might be able to accommodate you.
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow.
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
We may have a chance.
How does this strike you?
What's new?
He is a porter.
Allow me, Comrade.
What's that?
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?
If there is anything we can do for you...
How are you, you three scoundrels?
And your own gas cooker?
The same spring we had in Paris.
...and Kopalski.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
Give me another double brandy.
She must have her little joke.
You, please.
Can I help you?
Why do you need my finger?
You gave me some very valuable information.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
What do we do now?
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Do you hear that?
Was that talkative?
Thank you.
Glorious, analytical...
I must go.
Room service speaking.
Just an old man.
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
Not funny, huh?
I'll tell you that joke again.
I don't look too foolish?
You remember this room?
It's nine o'clock.
You see I couldn't shout that.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
She is very attractive.
I wouldn't know.
It's funny to look back.
How do you do?
Go on.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
Comrades! Comrades!
But, darling, you can't do that.
Are we going to build our little house?
I am so happy.
Would that make you any happier?
I have paid the penalty.
What shall we get? The news!
It's dead.
No music.
Come, sweetheart.
Is this the wish of the masses?
Comrades!
Trying to keep me away from you!
Hello, Leon!
It's really a wretched morning.
My little Volga boatman!
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific.
Did I hear something about jewels?
What did he say?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Make it ice cold.
Thank you.
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon.
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge.
Will you do me a favor?
Leon, darling, how nice!
Hello, Leon darling!
Now, please, Swana.
Not at all.
Isn't it amazing!
Good morning.
I think we can cut your visit short.
How stale last night's gaiety looks!
I wouldn't waken Leon.
Where are they?
They always belonged to the Russian people.
Here, please...
Well... that's my business, madame.
Good morning, Comrade.
Cigarette?
Oh, they shouldn't do such things.
This way, madame.
Bring me something simple.
Where to, madame?
Your Highness.
I am sorry... I have to leave.
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
You're lawyers.
We could check the tape again, sir.
How's the job coming, Bob?
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?
Mr.
Executive clemency ...
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
How much do you need?
He's right.
You want me to put it all in writing?
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
It was her wrist.
Yeah .
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
It's a code or something.
McCord? ...
I don't have time for all this shit!
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
Goddamn!
I like it.  I like the idea.
Where's Hunt now?
It's more than that.
We can't touch Hoover --
The soldiers were provoked.
He's in the dumps, sir.
He's begging for a meeting, chief.
The country's loving it.
No, you didn't, Bob.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
What about England?
This is June twentieth?
Sorry ...
May I say something, Mr. President?
No, sir, you did not.
You're all set, sir.
Exactly!
It's the President's personal property!
About a dozen.
Who?
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
"Victory at Sea," Al .
June twenty-third, '72, sir.
The army?
We can't survive this, sir.
They did what?
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
He works for Colson.
Well, why not?
Howard Hunt?
But what are we paying him for?
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing?
We've got to turn off the FBI.
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
Where are they?
Cue the crowd.
He wasn't protecting me.
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
Alright.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
... never complain, never explain, John ...
Get that little fucker!
Mr. President!
We really must go, Mr. President.
She got it, Bob.
And his staff.
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry.
You know, they all miss the point.
Congratulations, boss.
So that explains his press notices.
Because they're not Americans.
You know why they're turning on me?
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.
More light, chief?
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
Please!
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
I can't ...
It's a gift, Richard.
What'd he say?
Oh, no, Harold.
Mom expects great things from you ...
Diem?
And me? ...
Are you tapping Kissinger?
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr.
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.
What do you think this plan is, Edgar?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
... little Bobby.
Ummm...
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Oh, my goodness ...
Can't we just talk here?
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
You'll win the nomination.
Or he'll steal it like his brother.
Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
There must be a quarter-million out there, Edgar.
How the fuck did you know?
Why, you got a customer?
Where'd you find him?
Howard ... What the hell?
Mein Kampf?
Thanks, Jack.
Gentlemen, I tried.
So, what's this about, Dick?
Desi's got a point.
Mr.
Fuck it!
... as the old alliances crumble.
Exactly, sir.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
This will get me a second term.
That's right!
Housecleaning?
That doesn't matter now, Henry.
I was asleep, Mr.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
He was a politician.
Don't ever trust them.
You're too modest, Nixon.
It was illegal, what he did.
The lie?
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
Rocky's full of shit!
Uh, wait ...
How many?
This isn't '48, Dick.
You all right?
Get off that.
... give me a break, Mary.
But it was all we had.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany.
Hi.
That's Julie .
We didn't come here to talk about football.
No, we don't!
No, no.
We got the press this time!
No, they want you, Mr.
Bernstein.
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
What's in there?
And this?
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
We lost ...
It makes us human ...
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
What are you saying?
This is just what they want, Buddy.
Dick, don't...
We can be happy.
I'll do it.  No more.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
Were you planning to tell me?
Buddy? ...
Yes ... you know it!
He looked old, didn't he?
Hi, Buddy.
I don't need that, Buddy.
No, I don't.
Penny for your thoughts.
Congratulations, Dick.
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.
Yes.
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
I'm the only left, Dick.
No, it isn't.
Why didn't you?
It'll be over soon.
Howya doin'!
Oh, Happy!
How'd you know I was here.
How many a those things you got now?
Want a cup?
That man that shot you died in prison.
...What you got ain't nothin' new.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
No money in his room there?
None of that explains your man though.
Hard to believe.
Don't know why I did.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Who's Charlie Walser.
Yes ma'am?
Carla Jean...
Well. Old age flattens a man.
...You ride Winston.
I know this truck.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
These boys is all swole up.
We goin' in?
What about yours?
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
Probably must be.
...Now that's aggravating.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
What was the bullet?
Wasn't no bullet?
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
Yessir.
...This month's checks.
...What is it that Torbert says?
I thought it was a car afire.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
...Be careful.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
...How'd you sleep?
It ain't even three years we been married.
I got it Mama.
No.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
What's in the satchel?
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Did you buy that gun?
What'd you give for that thing?
Llewelyn.
Odessa.
So... for how long do we have to...
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Why all the way to Del Rio?
You can't afford one?
Llewelyn?
We don't have to do this.
You don't know to a certainty.
Yessir?
Where does he work?
Hello?
What's this about?
Huh? What is...
Mm-hm.
...Where's the transponder?
...You getting anything on this?
How'd you find it?
Yeah, that'll suck some power.
What airport would you use.
Who is this.
...You need to talk to me.
...I know where you are.
...Me?
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
...For instance.
How much?
...Will there be somethin' else?
Is somethin' wrong?
Will there be anything else?
...What time do you go to bed.
...I'd say around nine-thirty.
Well... I need to close now --
This was my wife's father's place.
Call it.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Twelve gauge.
Tent poles.
One room, one night.
Good. I need everything else.
Don't stop.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
Yessir, that's correct.
We got a loose cannon here.
Yessir.
...I'm wondering...
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
You tell me the option.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
Could I get another room.
What about one forty-two.
That's me.
Waitin' for my wife.
...Don't worry.
...But that won't last.
...What do you do?
Look.
Why would he go to Odessa?
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
...I'm across the river.
How is she?
Sorry you had to see that.
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
I'm in a motel.
Sheriff, I don't...
Yeah, it was great.
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
Why you always gotta embarrass me?
Jesus...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Oww, the arm, the arm!
What if the killers didn't see her?
What the hell do you want?
Why do I need to see this?
Yeah?
Come on, Elden, think about it.
Elden, let me out of here.
That's a lie!
We're in a shootout, Roy!
Need something else?
Who are these idiots?
Do you know who I am?
...I never meet people like you.
That's my son! My son is dead!
Ahh, it's too late, anyway.
What you did yesterday was reckless at best.
You can start tomorrow.
Did you watch it yet?
It's all right.
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Halfway where?
Tell Del I'm sorry.
...of course you do.
I beg your pardon?
That's very kind of you.
Oh, you mean Fred.
Why do they keep calling you George?
I guess we all did.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Lyla's very nice.
I don't think your friend likes me.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
Why are you doing this to me?
Oh. Of course... sorry.
So, call me when you --
What was that?
Sure you don't want any salad?
...like the water purifiers?
Well, are you gonna answer me?
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
What're you doing here, Roy?
Betty!
What's the matter here?
So you're into "Reason," too?
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Where you headed, Betty?
Let me tell you something.
I left my husband two days ago.
Piss off, Merle.
She called you 'George,' George.
What are you doing?
You don't sound like you're from here.
It's something I had to do.
You can go get your stuff right now.
I got this apartment with a guy.
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Hey, Rosa.
You made it!
Hey, how 'bout a card for me?
Guess who I saw today.
Why'd you help me in the first place?
I'm not going back on our arrangement.
So what do you say?
What are those for?
Looking for someone?
Were you with him this whole time?
Does he know you think he's real?
This isn't fair, you know.
Are you sure I can borrow this?
Rosa, so you've met David?
What are you doing?
...this is your sweater, right?
What?
What?
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
That won't be necessary.
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone.
The fuck you talking about?
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
I like this.
We appreciate that.
What do you mean?
Could you give us an example?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Relax, we brought the cash.
No, that's ignorant.
That's right.
Are you out of your mind?
This is great -- just great!
It's not here. Let's go.
Mmmm.
We can live with that.
Del's dead, by the way.
He's telling the truth.
What the hell was that, another statement?
Betty, Betty, Betty...
Let's get out of here.
They said find it.
Do I deserve this?
You don't look comfortable here.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
What?
How'd they describe her?
We should go.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon.
Well, guess what?
So you believed the bartender. Why?
Who's this?
What in the...  What the hell is this?
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
This is Betty at twelve.
...and how long did she work here?
What'd you get her?
Isn't that the point?
Seems like a nice place.
Really?
Jesus Christ!
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
She makes me stretch!
Is there a problem, George?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Let me try this, goddamnit!
Jesus, don't do that!
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
And she always had such spirit!
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
Nothin' complex about it.
What did you say?
SHUT UP!
You lie, motherfucker...
Mrs. Rogers?
Aren't they precious?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
Yeah?
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee.
End of the road, boys.
Waitaminute -
It ain't the law!
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
That's right!
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?

How'd he know about the treasure?
What do we do now, Everett?
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed!
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
Baptism.
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
Yeah, look at me.
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
Whuhh...
What on earth is goin' on here!
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
Uh, we uh-

Deceitful!
Huh.

We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
A miracle! It was a miracle!
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
What's his name again?
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Them straw polls is ugly.
Ass right.
Helluva idea.
Vernon Waldrip.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle.
McGill.
Where's your ring, honey?
That's not my ring.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
I counted to three, honey.
Wait a minute!
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
Huh?
How's this a plan?
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop.
Who was fixing to betray us!
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch.
The preacher said it absolved us.
A million dollars.
An' all my meals for free...
Me?
The hell it ain't square one!
It was a moment a weakness!
Fact of the matter - there never was!
But...
Pete... I do apologize.
This is crazy.
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
Two weeks!
Who's the honcho around here?
Sir, we are Negroes.
Languishing!
...Yeah?
I signed that bill!
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
Daddy!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
That's a maiden name.
It's bona fide!
She's at the five and dime.
You, Zack?
How was the flight?
This is it.
Come back here, kid!
Hi, Byron.
Hey, honey, look at this!
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
You... in the Navy?
Don't be pissed.
Hey, what did you want?
Who's that?
That's not how she told it.
I knew you'd make it!
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
Good morning, girls.
Zack, we've got to go.
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
Joe!
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack.
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
What's your name, boy?
Where'd you get this, Mayo?
I want your D.O.R.
Stop eyeballing me, mister!
I want to fly, sir!
Mayo, are those your friends?
You didn't kick him out...?

What're you waiting for, Mayo?
You're good.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
See you in the fleet, sir!
Hi, son.
What did you call me?
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
What did you call me, Mayo?
Stop eyeballing me, boy!
I know why most of you are here.
I don't know what it is.
Don't you dare ask me that question.
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Something tells me you've been here before.
You're sure it's okay?
What would you girls like to do?
What other issue is there, Sid?
Hi, babe.

You little bitch!
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
You got a girl?
I vote for the motel.
I shouldn't have done that.
You want me to fuck you?
You stayed after all.
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
That was great.
Want me to get a towel?
I'm sorry.
What's the matter?
Come on.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner?
Hi.
I'm so embarrassed.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
I'm looking for Sid.
I'd like to come with you.
Please stop it.
How do you figure that's your bunk?
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman.
I'll never get it polished in time.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
How about that prick!
Jets.
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Could you believe those girls!
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.
You okay?
Hey, you guys still awake?
What's the matter, Sweet Pea.
That isn't true, is it?
Thanks for covering for me.
You should've done what I did.
Talk to me in the morning.
Calm down, Sweet Pea.
So what's the problem?
Sid, what happened?
He's right, Zack.
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
What?
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
No problem.
You're welcome.
What if she called the cops?
What the fuck is funny about this?
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?
He said open it.
You should see the look on your face.
Stop it!  Stop it!
Me.  I am.
What?  What do you want me to do?
You can.
One.  Squeeze.
Are you okay?
The hell does she want?
She's gonna handle it.
That's your problem.
-- posed to mean?
Bullshit.
The walls are steel, right?
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Fuck.
Fuck!
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Who is this guy?
Unless Daddy comes back later.
Forty-five minutes.
They won't get hurt.
Asshole.
It's still a good plan.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior.
She said she did.
Yes.
Open it.
Be quiet.
Cell phone.
She's never coming out.
We're not leaving.
Yeah?
'Bout four o'clock.
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
Master bath.
Could the child please stop that?
Oh, I've seen these...
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!
That door is a safely hazard.
Working elevator.
A what?
That's highly inappropriate.
Push that button for me, will you?
Watch your mouth.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Cut it back a little bit.
We're leaving.
Suit yourself.
Something's weird.
Makes me nervous.
Too many stairs.
The phone works.
Fuck him.
What's going on?!
He's going down.
Damn it!
Can't hear a thing.
What do we do?
"What we want is in that room."
We're not coming out.
Oh, please.
Are you freaking out?
Small space?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
What, what, what is it?!
Morse code?
Got him!
We're never getting out of here.
Do it.
What are you doing?
Call Dad!
He'll do something.
I'm sorry.

Rodgers... this is no good...
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
I don't think that will be any problem...
Yes sir I was.
Did you shoot the officers in question?
That's right brother... listen and learn.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
We'll get them.
This here's a "Panther Patrol.

This cool the heat off you any?
Rose?
God damn it's him.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
When?
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Am I one of that sort?
Well?
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
What do you mean, old and ugly?
He shouldn't make light.
I know him well enough?
You got salt last week.
You look well, Charlotte.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
Excuse me?
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
You're surrendering.
We did.
Shall we proceed?
You are familiar with how these things are done.
Thank you.
Very well, let us move on to...
Their names, ranks and posts?
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
If I fail, you fail.
Civility is a secondary virtue.
Do you see that, Colonel?
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.
What news?
Father, I've lost respect for you.
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
Father...
What now, sir?
Did your father teach you humility?
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
Is it?
Less than a mile.
These four wagons must be his.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough.
Don't go in there.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
We buried them, then we went to track.
It was a different time, son.
There are some letters here from him.
An American nation.
Damn it, Francis!
A long time ago...
You were an Englishman then...
Wars are not fought only by childless men.
One of yours?
We're a breath away from losing this war.
His wife was killed yesterday.
Don't touch him.
Goodbye, Francis.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Your son, what did you name him?
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
How far away?
Don't worry.
Reverend.
Thank you.
How many came back?
Gray.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
Not yet, Thomas.
Seventeen.
Put those away.
Father?
Father, you can't let them take him...
Father... I killed those men...
Who might you be, little Miss?
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Do you know what this place is, Ellie?
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
Ellie.
It's gorgeous!
Yes, but the rope might be--
Honey, Church will be fine.
I want to fly it!
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
There are no ghosts, Ellie.
Please hurry.
Yes.
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
No-I guess not.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
That's what I think.
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Yes.
Is he really all right?
I've noticed it, too.
She's in bed.
Ellie? What's wrong?
What's up, sugar?
But don't you dare say that.
I think we go on.
I don't get it.
I'm not tired!
Ellie--
Be good to your mother, darlin'.
Do you swear?
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
How can you call it a good thing?
Was it Pascow?
Hey--they actually found the place!
You need a glass?
God, that's fine.
Nice.
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
You folks ready to go on?
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
Not yet...how much further is it?
I can hardly read these.
No--not right out loud.
It's Church.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Bagged cat. What a mess.
Going to tell Ellie?
No need to apologize.
Jud, this is crazy.
What say, Louis?
What do you mean?
We can't climb over that.
No, you shouldn't have stopped.
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
It's funny, all right.
Almost there, Louis.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
What are those for?
Doesn't look like they last long.
But--
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive.
Can I have another one?
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Rachel not feeling well?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Poor Missy.
I want to wake up.
Please, I want to wake up.
The door must not be opened.
Let her go. It's cool.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
Gage's gone!
Thank you. Thank you so much.
The movers--
My God!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
She's finally asleep.
Don't be silly.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
You'll be fine, Ellie.
Well, honey...you know that...
Thank you, Louis.
Getting there.
I heard you tonight.
I'm going to try to do better.
You better get going, hon.
You stole my boat.
My dory.
How does he do that?
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
What's in your head, boy?
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
No!  You gave your word!
Hah.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
That's your offer?
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
No, I really think I do.
Why don't I want to do this?
There's ... another exit?
So what now, Jack Sparrow?
Now?
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
No reason to fret.
Do you believe him?
My apologies, miss.
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.
I'll drop it!
You have a name, missy?
You've got sand, for a maid.
Maid or not, it fits you.
Do you not know what this is, then?
The curse drove you to gather this?
Agreed.
Man overboard!
Did he speak?
Commodore, I must protest.
On his heels!
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
Elizabeth?
It's -- beautiful.
I knew it.
Difficult ... to say.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
What?
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
I'm glad we got here in time.
Why would my father send this to me?
There.
Miss Swann.
You are despicable.
You?!
Come on!
Captain Sparrow!
What?
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
That was before I met one, of course.
To freedom.
What are you doing?
Why?
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.
Make it last, then.
Say again?
We'd best drop canvas, sir!
How did you get off the island?
Blast it, I'm already awake!
I'll tell lee.
It's a signal.
Raise the sails.
Hands!
All the men in place, sir.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
Dead serious.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
What's your name?
None?
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
We had time to get to know each other.
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.
Do you think this is wise, boy?
Who makes all these?
You cheated.
Move away.
Are you familiar with that ship?
I can get you out of here.
Agreed.
Not without my effects.
Why are brothering with that?
Come aboard.
We're going to steal a ship?
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Everybody stay calm.
I knew him.
Put it away, Will.
Tortuga?
Just do it quickly.
Shut up, before you lose them all!
Wait -- what about the pistol?
But I survived.
What's that?
Miss Swann!
No.
Will -- don't do anything stupid!
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Are you certain this is the right way?
Jack!
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr.
I think he's telling the truth.
He's still breathing.
What happened here?
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
Commodore --
How long do you leave him in there?
Mr.
Wheelchair accessible.
Not anymore, Mr.
Mr.
Dr.
You can't mean that.
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
We will always love most that which we create.
I brought you up here, Dr.
Pollution?
What are you going to do to him?
What did you use?
I can explain it.
... plastic.
How apropos.
I know what you're doing.
You can't do this!
Like rotting meat.
Oh no?  Smell this.
Icky!  What's happening?
It works, Poppy.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Do you think she will give us the designs?
You know how I feel about you.
Look at me, Icarus!
Icarus?
Can you feel it, Poppy?
It will be an ascension.
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Poppy, please --
Did you feel that?
Okay.
Facts, Dr.
Where did he go?
They're here!
Dr.
Excellent work, Dr.
Hey!
Here, kid, this is great stuff.
Yeah?  So what?
What is it with you litterbugs?
What?
What did security say?
You were never invited to my house.
Of course, sir.
I don't believe this is happening...
There's a guard outside my door!
I'm a scientist.
Yes?
What's it smell like?
Sir, please try to hold still.
Susan!
Daniel...
When did you...?
Somebody has to.
Yeah.
Nothing really worthwhile.
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!
Daniel, give him the Trix.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
They did it to me!
... just like the mouse.
You don't know?
Oh no, no, no!
Oh God, please!
We don't have time for hysterics.
What are these?
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
Why do we need it?
That was an egg?
Lungs sound fine.
Is something wrong?
Susan!
Look at this!
Just look at it!
Oh yeah, real funny.
What's that supposed to mean?
Just like old times.
I feel very emotional right now.
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
What's wrong?
How far can you stretch?
I'm going to go out for a while.
I could go with you.
That's pretty good.
What's that?
You made this out of my hair?
Did you go?
Who is he?
Oh no.
I don't believe it.
Oh no!
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
You saved my life.
Susie... I...
What in the...?
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
Daniel, just forget Argon.
You're not going after Argon!
Things do change.
You!  I remember you!
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun.
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.
All the different ways that I could kill you.
That's impossible.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
Vermin...
I could have you fired right now.
Icky!
What in the hell?
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Indeed? How interesting.
I think I better go, Stew.
Don't mind Mother.
May I use your telephone?
That's a good idea - telephone the police.
What do you want?
That's considerate of you.
Ah!
Where did you get those letters?
I suppose you're going to print them?
Oh, I don't need another guess.
Will you step into the library?
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
I don't know how to thank you.
Really?
Oh, Mother!
Hello, Natalie.
Why should I?
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous.
A little?
What's the matter?
Your place?
We could have the whole left wing?
You have the cutest nose I've
I've got a present.
Do you like them?
Oh, yes, of course.
Yes.
No? What do you look upon her as?
Is this true, Stewart?
Stewart!
I'm not going!
Anne, come here. Listen
Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.
Oh, that mob downstairs.
What's the idea, Anne?
That's an excellent idea.
What is this person doing here?
Good morning, Mother.
Ah-ah-ah!
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency?
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
a beautiful pair of shoulders!
What's the matter?
Fine. Have a seat.
This way.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
I got him his job on the paper.
Yeah!
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Thank you very much.
Say, take it easy!
Impossible. Put it on again.
What do you want?
How's that?
I bring a message from Garcia.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out.
Look, I quit!
Aagh!
It has been alleged - yes
Well, when are you quitting?
Mr. Schuyler .
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
How do you like your bath, sir?
Who are you?
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Yes.
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Say, you are nice.
All right, outside!
I think I understand, sir.
That's a canary, sir.
Yes.
That's a lovely dress.
Stew, your hands are shaking.
The boss is getting hoarse.
You what?
And with it came love!
Sure, sure.
Well, well, well!
Sure, you ran away.
Thanks, thanks.
Oh sure, we'll be happy.
Ah!
Oh, I'll call you up some time.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good!
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
I'm sorry, Stew.
You know what I should do with you?
How far have you gotten?
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Did who?
Hey, Gallagher!
Who was that?
It's a swell idea, Gallagher.
What other girl?
Well, well.
A statement? Good.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
I think you'd better go.
Hello, Smith.
Wait a minute.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack?
We just thought that
Yes.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
What is it, Smythe?
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Double-strength!
Pardon me, madam.
Smythe, you've been drinking.
Indeed?
Stop calling me Mother!
And you struck him right here in our house?
What's going on here?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
Now, now Jeeves.
But I
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Did you call, sir?
Shhh! Do you hear something?
No, that's enough.
That's puttering, sir.
Smythe, I'll get this.
It isn't done, gentlemen!
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue.
Mary Sue?
Can I ask you a question?
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
What?
You sure you want to know this?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Bud.
Why no.
Oh no ... I'm fine.
It's okay. It's alright.
Have you got any make up?
Does it look okay?
Wait.
Thank you.
I made you these for the trip.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Oh, hello Betty.
Oh, hi ...
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
Having kind of a tough time.
Where'd you get this?
What?
Wait ...
It's alright. Let me see.
What is that?
You can't go out there.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Like a drum.
How was your day?
I told you where I was.
Look.
Look at me George.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
What's all the commotion?
... And you always seemed so smart and everything.
Sure is pretty.
... Why?
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
Oh.  I can't.
I'm busy.
Don't! Just let go.
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
What'll it be?
Maybe you can't even describe it.
C'mon.
Want some bridge mix?
Oh my gosh.
No.
Are you alright?  What is it?
What happened?
Did you do this?
Do you know that it's illegal?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
You're not allowed to do this!
I think I've got something to say.
It's like the basketball team.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
Dan! Arrest them!
How'd you know about the fire?
And where's that?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Hello Bud.
Mr. Simpson ...
What are you doing?
David, cut it out.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Lemme see that.
Do you mind.
God, David. Just give it to me!
Oh my God.
What did you do?
Noooooo!
Oh God.
I don't believe this.
I'm gonna hurl, David.
You know him?
Who's that?
Those are my friends.
No way.
JENNIFER!
Jen, listen ...
I could like kill a guy with these things.
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.
What did you do to him?
You can't do this, Jennifer.
You have no right to do this.
Me too. Sounds swell.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
What's wrong?
You're reading?
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
So what is it?
Can I ask you a question?
Are you sure?
Besides.
You got the admissions letter.
That was sure swell ...
Keeps going ...
Hi.
Sure ... Where would we go?
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
Mmmmgh.
So what's it like?
How?
Do they have an Ocean?
You want some berries?
I picked them myself.
What's going on?
What do we do?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Can I open it?
Where are they?
You're gonna forget about me.
I like calling you David.
Salesman.
You're unbelievable.
Holy cow.
... Her father.
Yeah ...
How much does it cost?
Why would I do that?
Look--we appreciate it.
Don't get upset.
Hello there.
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
I want a word with you ...
What do you mean?
OKAY.
Where's the remote control I gave you?
OW!
Hope you're proud of yourself.
I don't know what went wrong.
How long do you think you've been here?
Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow.
There's worse places.
Bud?
What's wrong?
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Do you have the lettuce?
Oh hi!
Bud ...
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
You know what I really like?
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
Well don't you?
Oh, hi.
It's an art book.
What's wrong?
It's okay.
It's beautiful.
TV repair.
You think you could do this like soon?
Gosh, I loved that show.
Um--hello?
Free?
Told you it was your lucky day.
Dream come true, hunh?
Oh GOD ...
Hey.
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
This is Barry.

What city?
Hey, how are you?
You just said very food.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Hey, what are you doing?
It's not cool?
Yeah I can't.
What's all this pudding?
Goodbye.
Hey. What are you doing?
What about her?
Hello, this is Back.

I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Hello?
So you think you can?
Hello?
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Hello?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
There's a piano in the street.
Hi.
Business is good, you're busy?
What do you do with all this pudding?
Oh My God.
That's great -- Hawaii.
It was great to meet you again.
This is funny.
Who is it?
...really?
That's very nice.
Is everything ok?
There's a better place for us to eat.
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
This is Barry.
That was good.
Hello?
You got me out of my hotel room.
Do you wanna have sex?
Oh my god, you are so adorable.
I know.
Where do you have to go?
How many times have you been on an airplane?
I forgot about that.
Are you ok?
Lena I'm so sorry.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Why?
Yeah.
Can I pay you here?
Who is this?
Now are you threatening me, dick?
I'm a nice and reasonable man.
Can we agree that that is that?
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
Sorry about that.
How many sisters do you have?
How you doin' Barry?
Yeah.
What's up?
This is Janice the operator, who's this?
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, good morning, Barry.
What is this?
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
Good morning, Barry....
It's not a piano.
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
What's up?
Ok.
....now: this pudding?
Where you been?
Hey.
HEY.
Ok.
They need to be scanned individually.
This is Barry.
I don't really remember that.
That's cool.
Your expenses are your own.
So they'll go.
...keys for the track.
Hello?
It's ok. That's alright.
I'll go pay for my car.
We should be going --
Are you ready?
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
I don't believe it.
Marquis? Is that you?
Madeleine --
Has he hurt you?
Ow!
In part, yes.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
Go back to your room. Quickly.
Free his mouth.
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
Take your pen in hand, Marquis.
Yes!
If you only mean to dupe me again --
You mean to take us all down with you?
He can't do that to me.
What the devil --
I'll die of loneliness!
I have a proposition.
My bed, gone!
Virgin birth -- ha!
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS!
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it?
It's no secret that you loved her.
Don't confuse one organ with another --
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES!
I dare you.
Abbe de Coulmier!
Dr. Royer-Collard?
Indiscretions, Abbe?
And he's never once attempted escape?
Oh. That.
On the contrary.
Well?
It was fiction, of course.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe.
I'll do everything in my power --
He'll do no such thing.
As you say, Doctor.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
As for the author... shoot him.
Charenton?
Here it is; the last chapter.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride!
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes!
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel!
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
Did I frighten you?
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
A kiss for each page.
It's a long story, this one.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
What have they done to you now?
They've taken your clothes?
Surely you've seen a man naked.
The Abbe's sending me away.
Yes; that's it!
...yes, I've got that bit...
"...your wife."
I beg to differ, Doctor.
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
I am eternally in your debt.
Good God, Marquise --
This is neither the time nor the place --
Public scorn carries a terrible sting.
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
For fuck's sake, woman!
How was I to know, my darling?
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper!
Leave at once --
Doesn't that please you?
Ever met Walter Winchell?
So you ever gonna do a picture?
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
That poor woman.
God, these parties are the worst
It's not so bad here.
When I met him I was just 20.
Who are you, sir?
Well, I wish you luck.
I wonder.
Louis

There. That's right.
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
How bad is it?
The S.

How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Well -- he got us, didn't he?
Then you explain it to me?!
That -- did you need that?
That's right.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
It's all you.
Thank you for your time
He lied to me
I want blood
Keep filming.
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion.
That's right.
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture

Sigmund Freud?
Manolete?!
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars?
Look at those hands.
Mank!
Oh for Christ's sake-
Yes.
Let me out.
He'll destroy us.
So, who is he?
All men love.
It's 350 pages long.
It's good, huh?
Jesus Christ --
I want you back
Did I ever tell you about my father?
Hey, kid. Gregg.
No, but I can imagine.
Who owns this town?
Is that from one of the Gospels?
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN!
You gonna watch?
Shit
What have I done?
They came to me with an offer.
Monstro!
May I help you?
It came.
You talked to New York?
Yes
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
For the title
This is an abomination There's no music and--
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
What do you want me to do, Orson?
Listen to me.
This isn' t some kinda fucking game!
You're not still mad at me, I hope
I think you better sit down
It's my birthday this week.
Oh God. . .
Orson, you wanna take five?
It's just not low enough.
How 'bout a real drink?
Oh, no--
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
Hey champ!
All right.
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
What's up, Colonel?
What who's been sayin'?
This looks done.
Here's your carrots.
Where you going at this hour?
J.R., glad you could make it.
You're a good sport, lady.
What's wrong?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
That's what I'm sayin'.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
What was that for?
Answer me when I talk to you.
And that hard-on, Salvy.
Who's that?
Hey, watch your mouth.
Do you see her yet?
They robbed us!
You want us to wait for you?
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161.
Nah, she would never...
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
Whatcha doin'?
Stick out your hands, Jake.
See? That's all there was to it.
I'm gonna order up some stuff.
Screw you, Jack.
What?
How's that?
Answer me somethin'.
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
You givin' me that look.
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy?
Why not?
Ain't she beautiful?
Don't fight anymore!
It ain't worth it, Jake.
Joey said you wanted to meet me.
You don't talk very much.
You go first.
That's it.
I can't find my ball.
Can you see it?
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Jake...
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Take off my pants.
Now take the rest off.
I like the gym smell.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
Joey's right.
What're you lookin' at?
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
What's the matter with you?
I went out.
Where you been all day?
Jake, no --
I didn't do anything wrong.
Come out of there!
I'll say anything you want me to say.
You're killing him.
You're the fuckin' animal!
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
I'm sorry.
Open the door, Vickie.
Vickie, open up.
The kids are sleeping.
What are you doing?
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
Fuckin' kid!
How's the weight? Ok?
All right, lemme ask you something.
Salvy, would I steer you wrong?
Hey, leave the kids alone.
I can't convince him.
Talk some sense into him, will ya?
I said, let's go.
What're you doin' with Salvy?
This is Doyle's house.
This is the baby sitter.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
Like disposing of their wives?
Mrs.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
Feel a little foolish?
Who said they left then?
The building superintendent, and two tenants.
Forget the story -- find the trunk.
Jewelry?
Did you ever own a saw?
But I'm not a killer!
Oh -- that phone call!
Jefferies.
Just don't dally.
Jefferies.
This is Wednesday.
Where?
Read some good books.
Yeah?
Hello.
Hello.
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
Can you get me that ring back?
I can't.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
I predicted it.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
I knew it!
It's very simple.
You're never going to marry?
Look, Mr.
We've progressed emotionally in --
Keep your mind off her.
His personal effects.
What about this morning? Any developments?
A Federal offense.
I'm not shy.
Goodbye, Mr.
Mrs. Thorwald?
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
There's a dip at this end.
You shouldn't have let her do that!
Thank heaven that's over!
I wonder.
You know?
What are you two talking about?
What's she trying to do?
What do you need money for?
One hundred and twenty-seven.
Ten here.
What about the rest?
Hello.
It is something really important, Jeff?
How's your leg?
Depends on the quote.
Something big going on somewhere?
Big enough?
What a day I've had!
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home?
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
That's what is know as "manless melancholia.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
Oh.
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Oh, I do that all the time.
Huh?
Don't you ever have any problems?
What do you think?
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
Lisa, please!
No comment.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
I wonder where he's going now?
Something on your mind, Lisa?
But only her husband would know that.
We have all -- what?
I have the whole weekend off.
From his landlord -- once a month.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.
I hate funny exit lines.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
I'll rephrase the question.
Do you like it?
Well?
Something's in there.
Wasn't that close?
What for?
Get an ambulance.
Steady Marlon!
What's that?
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Feel okay?
What's happening?
You know something?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Meaning me?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
Machismo?
You satisfied or you want more?
Where can we meet?
Just him.
What you say your name was?
Sure.  It's fine.
This is the edge, boy.
We heard firing.
What's he going to pull--
You see any cops?
What time is it?
Tell him why we moved here.
Mother--
So long, young fella.
You thought I was Mom?
You awake?
Hey--I want to ask you something.
Blood.
Go ahead.
Will you let him tell it!
I don't think so--
Except yourself!
You know you did wrong.
Son--this is all happening so fast--
He depended on me.
Whoa!
Excuse us a minute?
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
You sure?
Can't you answer?
Was it because we went to that party?
No!
Look Jim.
Frank?  I'm frightened.
See?  It stopped.
Who's there?  Anyone there?
Is he there?
Frank!
John Crawford?
She keep it to protect herself, sir.
They not together, sir.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
He's not here.
Hi.
Boy!
You shouldn't monkey with him.
What's your name!
I'm here.
Are you really going to meet them?
How'd you get here?
I got to go in.
Jim!
Hey where'd you go?
We're safe here.
Isn't it crazy?
Nobody talks to children!
Let's see how long we can stay under.
Isn't he schizoid?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
I came here before.
What you run out on me for!
I don't want you for my father!
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
Plato?
That's swell.  How are you?
I'm not going to hurt you.
No.
Can I keep it?
You promised to give it back.
Who's that?
Those aren't my friends.
Plato!
What?
I'm sorry.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
'Bye, Mom.
What happened, darling.
How!
No!
He's not saying that!
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Get lost.
Too bad you didn't connect.
That why you moved from the last town?
He called me chicken.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
What a zoo!
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Plato!
Hi.  I saw you before.
Where's Dawson High School?
The kids take me.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
They'll be looking for you.
You still pretty upset?
You cold?
Like even today.
Why did you do that?
Where you going?
You can trust me, Judy.
Oh, Jim!
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
You can't talk underwater!
Ever been in a place like this before?
Want to read any books?
What?
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
No!
After he tried to shoot you?
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.
Is he your friend?
Don't give it a thought.
Children?
Shall I show you the nursery?
Plato, where's your father now?
Hi, Plato!
Judy--we're ready for you now.
What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
She's being called for.
How did you know that?
Good evening.
Didn't you forget something?
I was talking to Dad.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
So.
Is this him!?
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
Gabriel, you promised!
You promised me!
Gabriel!
He wants the money.
He wants... your "sister"...
I can't take watching you touch him.
Y'know something, baby?
Gabriel!
You can't find... what?
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
Do that again.
No --
Tell me something.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Where the hell are you going?
Ashley, Jesus --
You need a COAT!
You forget where I work?
Well, I don't know about that --
NO!
I'm not him.
I won't let 'em, Nick.
...the truck driver...
You motherfucker.
I'M NOT NICK!
Get the hell off of me!
He'll kill you.
Your pen palls dead, lady.
Gabriel!
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you?
He said he wanted to talk to you.
I thought we'd have a few more days.
They've never done a robbery?
Then they do need me, don't they.
Get your own room, Ashley.
So does it look a lot different?
That guy knows you?
Nick, what happened --
You saved my life.
They'll have guns.
He wants to see your map.
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
Here's the Picasso.
I don't know where you're going.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
You... you... YOU --
I saved your life.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
What?
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
You... you don't know me --
Who are you now.
You're not Nick Mason...
You're a good writer, Nick.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
I had better sex in prison.
Where's she work?
Be more specific.
Let's get back on the road.
You knew the place --
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
Hey, it's... been two years --
Hell. Ten?
What?
We walked the place for a week.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
So what the hell good are you...
They won't recognize me.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
Rather be back in the Mountain?
A cowboy.
Do I get a country-western name?
Y'know what, guys?
You got one hour.
Ten dollars?
Got something to say to me, Nick?
What'd you tell that casino manager?
Start singing.
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway.
So.
NO.
I want a map of that security level.
No gun.
You gotta be kidding me.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
You are lucky, convict.
Get in the CAR!
Ash?
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
Here ya go, convict.
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
Where the HELL did he go?
Mister.
He won't tell us where it is.
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
...so where is he?
I can't go back to Vegas...
I CAN'T!
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay?
The Powwow Safe?
What about the Powwow Safe?
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you.

You knew there were guns in here!
Monsters in the gelatin...
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
What's the first thing, man?
Hot chocolate.
She's gonna be out there, man.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
She's using a new perfume.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Just a roach, Zook.
Rudy, don't move --
Don't move, Rudy!
GUARD! GUARD!
Jesus, Rudy --

They had the weapons and the willpower.
That was my card, pop!
POP! That was My card!
Switch seats with me.
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.

Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Without having them hit the alarms.
Alone at last.

You fuckin' wish.
Seymour Scagnetti.
I don't wanna lift crates.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
Let me tell you guys a story.
I don't buy it.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
Daddy, did ya see that?
We can work this out, can't we?
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?
Nuts.
What does it matter who stays with the cop?
The black Beverly Hills.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
Didja use the commode story?
What's this?
Tell me more about Cabot.
Jesus Christ!
Let's go over it. Where are you?
Myself and Mr. Pink?
I'm sorry.
Just hold on buddy boy.
Who's your parole officer?
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.
Toby... who the fuck is Toby?
Wong?
But he's OK.
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
Yeah, Mr.
Nobody's trading with anybody!
Mr. Blue's dead?
What's that?
Give me this fucking thing.
No, she did it.
What's she doin' now?
What's the cut, poppa?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Don't worry, Eddie.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling.
Aren't you?
I know.
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
So, talk.
What's this guy's problem?
Follow you where?
For what, the cops?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie?
Because this guy's a fucking psycho.
I told 'em not to touch the alarm.
Hey, just cancel that shit right now!
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
Just hold on buddy boy.
I ain't going anywhere.
What happened?
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
These ladies aren't starvin' to death.
Do you know what this is?
Gun shot.
What the fuck am I doing here?
Want a smoke?
Okay, let's go through what happened.
Tagged a couple of cops.
So, is he dead or what?
Why!
We had just gotten away from the cops.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
He got it in the belly.
Is that supposed to be funny?
I told ya he'd be pissed.
Okay, Mr.
Who cares what your name is?
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
You should be.
Who shot who?
Tell them to come on in.
Anybody hurt?
What's the matter with her?
And this is Helen Carter.
Yes, ma'am.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
Our kind of women?
What's the matter with her?
And this is Helen Carter.
So am I.
Thanks.
Of course it'll work.
There's a nice boy.
Like what?
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
So that was why she tried to run away.
Coffee?
You don't have to explain.
He knows his alphabet.
Are we leaving?
Better go on back and get some more sleep.
Don't you trust me?
You should have.
Tell me, darling.
What did you expect?
I'm awake now.
No, I'm not all right.
All my clothes --
Go on, take it.
I won't have you fighting over me.
I can't change either.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Thanks for taking over.
Where you going?
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
I found their surrey --
I -- lost something.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
I can't --
How does she draw?
That's right.
Who's Lednov?
What was he in jail for?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
They sure must have been travelin'.
I've got eleven horses.
Where'd they go?
There was only three of them at first.
Okeh, I was wrong.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
All right, I hurt your feelings.
Come on.
Go on, hit me.
I said keep your nose out of my life.
You know what she asked me?
Half of them are mine.
What did you come back for?
Is that the only reason you came back?
How's that?
You can light the lamp.
Yeah, how did you know?
I'm sorry about this, Mr.
You're not bein' quite fair.
I'm sorry about this, Mr.
You're not bein' quite fair.
You can't stay here.
Runnin' off and worryin' people.
I'm not going anywhere.
Go away -- please.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
You got no business snoopin' around --
That something I shouldn't see?
What is it?
Go on.
That sure smells good.
I figure we'll get along just fine.
What's the matter -- restless?
Suppose I take a look.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
There you are.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr.
Goodbye and thanks.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong.
You're not giving up?
Maybe I better start working on him.
Go on. Have another try at him.
We might as well start a fire.
Give it back to him.
I'm sure of this.
Mary, Honey.
How do you know who we are?
Clay Phillips.
How far up the trail?
We got to get movin'.
I said let's go.
We got company. Female company.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
He dropped a shoe.
What are you doin' --
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
It wasn't Clay's fault.
Would you like to learn them?
You're so nice.
Good night, Miss Wells.
Gee, I can't.
Aren't we stayin'?
What comes after Z?
And that's tough, isn't it?
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
Well, Steve?
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping.
Don't pay any attention to him.
She was only teasin'.
You stretch out.
Goodnight.
Are you okay?
Brenda was right.
Oh, he was a widower.
No, I won't let you do it.
Hey, Brenda.
Me, too. 101?
And remember that trip we took to Africa?
My favorite memory was when we --
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Ouch!!
Help!
Oh my God! We're dead!
It's coming!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy!
Cindy, what's going on?
Hello Brenda.
Shhh... It's okay.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
He's right. I should go first.
Where's Shorty?
Ray, run faster.
Hey, you left your book back there.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Hi Buddy.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Buddy...
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Whoa, check this out.
Where the hell are we?
Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
What about you, Buddy?
He's here.
What are we gonna do?
Feel that?
Better try a little higher.
Cindy, let me...
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Stop it!
Hey, look out, a bee!
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
What should we get?
Are you okay?
Good-night, Cin.
Okay, I get the point.
Let her go, Cin.
How about these buns?
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Where's Shorty?
Ray, you saved my life.
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
I'm Cindy.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Morphine?
Hanson, please.
Stop touching his brain!
Tell me, Cindy.
Stop! --
It was you...
Noooo!!!
What the hell are you doing?
He won't let us go.
What are we gonna do?
Father!
I'm sorry.
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Am I cool now?
Aww, the little bird died.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Did you do that?
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
I got it!
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
Got a problem with that?
I take it you're not mad at me.
I don't like this, this...
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Oh, my God.
I finished all the interviews.
Let me help you.
Here you go, Professor.
Yes.
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
I'm going to change for dinner.
Not to worry.
My God! Is she dead?
Professor, I think you should see this.
The image there.
What the hell?!
Professor, we need to talk.
I can do it myself.
Hello Dwight.
What are you working on?
Work, work, work.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky.
She's right. We should stick together.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
It's the best seat in the house.
You never could feel your legs.
Alright... I might need your help.
You're not wearing a belt.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
I'm so glad you're here.
Father.
Would you like to see the girl?
Father, are you okay?
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
No thanks.
Father, I think you should rest.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
Yo son, check this out.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
This part removes the sense of humor.
I woke up naked, too.
"Ray!"
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
BLOOD FEAST!
Hi, Mom.
Oh, boy! 
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Did you hear?
What a bitch!
...Jenner.
I saw blood!
Bring her home... I guess.
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Here we go again.
Hi!
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
 I'm not kidding.
How about Mrs. Ackerman?
DAD!
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
Just a little, please.
You'd probably date him!
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.
I'm Dr.
Carl's a jerk!
No comment!
Sorry, ma'am.
You see the sign!
Cute is not enough, Misty.
Chip, honey?
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
You kids.
Bye, Birdie.
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
CHIP!!
Tell me the truth, Mom!
In here, Mom...
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
Are you Chip Sutphin?
Detectives, what is this about?
What is it, officers?
We hope so, son.
He goes to college with me!
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
Hi, Hank.
Look at this!
Sorry, son.
Chip, your ride is here.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.
Goodnight, honey.
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
There's Dede!
I'm sorry, honey.
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Det.
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
"P" as in...
Objection! Argumentative!
Hello.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
MOTHERFUCKER!!
Just a half-a-cup.
What did you just say?
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
So you do drink?
Did you see her?
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
State your name, please.
Mr. Pickle!
Ooohhhhhh!
Who wants fruit salad?
And who may I ask is Carl?
He killed people, Mom.
Yummy.
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
It's him!
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
0h, that's horrible, honey.
Beverly, are you alright?
Just the damn cable TV company.
That's like your car, Beverly,
Mrs... Sutphin?
Chip is off to a fine start this year.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
Man, that one made me puke!
SHE DID IT!
Murder, honey.
What was that?
What is it, Betty?
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
I'll take this instead.
You know who I am, August?
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson.
I don't like this.
You scared?
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
We can't stand here all night.
When I wanted to.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
You're a curious man.
It's not just for myself I'm asking.
How much does she want?
I haven't got that much in cash.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
But tell me --
Why, Mary --
I don't get this.
I can't see much fun in teaching school.
The tip is, anyhow.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
What did she want?
We're not exactly strangers, Mary.
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
I'm sorry.
What brought you down here, Greg?
 What have you done about Irving August?
She's got to be found.
Don't.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
That was Dr.
No.
I'm going to find your sister.
Well?
Do you think he knows about this?
Could you find him?
What's that?
Let her know what?
She'll have to know some time.
Who are you?
I'm tired of being afraid - of waiting.
Please, Jacqueline.
Good-bye, darling.
You'll be all right?
Were you going to make a suggestion?
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
I have been at the library.
Look.
I want you to see my room.
I can't find Gregory.
I hate people who try to peddle comfort.
Jason, my pet 
What are you thinking of, Bella?
Oh, Mr.
And the other was Judd?
Why, Mr.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
See that girl?
What was she to you?
Following me to find Jacqueline?
This is curious, Jason.
Wait - there is that other favor.
Perhaps.
What?
Dr. Judd?
Don't be so amazed.
It's my cloven hoof.
Yes.
Would they hurt her?
I was a great dancer...
Is it about Jacqueline?
I'm afraid not.
Yes.
That makes it all the more difficult 
I'm worry to bother you.
No -- the rent in paid.
Fo come ti pare.
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
I went back through the history last night.
But she told him, Frances.
I have taken care of Mary.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
Sorry.
Ann?
That was quick.
Do you have other things?
Have you ever been on television?
Graham is an unusual name.
...free-lance. You know.
Oh, uh-huh.
Why'd you drop out?
This food is excellent.
Mother, father, sister.
I don't know.
Do I pay taxes?
Would you mind?
Yeah, I know.
Can I tell you something personal?
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
So what about kids?
So what's your personal thing?
You're what?
Does it bother you?
Hi!
What are these?
It's a personal project I'm working on.
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
What... what are these interviews about?
I'm not sure why I came here.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
Do you think that's such a good idea?
How do you pay for all this?
Tell me your name.
Tell me your name.
Do you talk to him?
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Is he going to see this?
Did you have sex before you were married?
Yes, I have. I will.
No.
Yes.
So you do fantasize?
Have you fantasized about me?
Can't.
You're really never going to make love again?
I can't.
Who? Elizabeth?
Don't do that.
Come on!!
Why are you ashamed?
I want to touch you.
Graham...
Oh, we get along okay.
John?
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
Yes. I just got busy.
Then maybe I saw an old message.
Something wrong?
I'm sorry, too.
Jesus Christ!
Where did you go when you left here?
Goddammit, goddammit!
Answer me, godammit!
Goddam right.
Bastard...
You son of a bitch!!
I have thought about it, yes.
God damn you!!
Yes, I remember.
Are you afraid of his reaction?
When did you begin having this feeling?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
What do you mean?
Well, I don't know.
What brought this on?
I hate my sister.
I don't know.
Is he? Strange, I mean?
Lose something?
He just asked me questions.
Yes, I did.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
Here it is.
I was just trying to --
So what's my share of the dress?
Thank you.
Do you have my work number?
I get real busy between two and four.
Bye.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off?
No, I touched me.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
Well, why would she want a sun dress?
Who are you?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Would you like me to take my pants off?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Hello.
No.
I've got to get back to the office.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
Hello.
John?
Hello.
John Millaney.
Hello.
I don't know.
Do you want me to stop calling?
I felt like it, so what?
Come on, John.
Plenty of room for two people.
Everybody has a past.
Yeah, it's not bad.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
Hi, John.
Give me your keys.
Your keys, asshole!
Answer him, goddammit!!
IBM.
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Millaney?
...probably nothing at all.
Hi.
Oh, you feel very good, Betts.
Jesus!
Dr. St. Luc?
It was very strange.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor.
OK, Roger.
Kiss, kiss?
Another kiss?
Roger?
Anything wrong?
Forsythe, Forsythe!
Where is he now? Do you know?
But where are you going?
Can I call you at the office?
You say something?
Do you want to make love?
What happened?
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
Yes? Who is there?
Want me to breathe deeply?
Good shape for an old man, eh?
I know.
Right.
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you.
Yes?
OK, I bite.
He didn't make it.
OK.
NIGHT NIGHT
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
BREAKING OUT
You bet, Bert.
Later, Brenda.
How's Brad?
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
About Brad's family?
You got it!
Infantile regression.
Introduce yourselves.
I know, I know, it's just...
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
Right!
When do I get to see Brad?
But...how?
SIN-I-FUL
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
How did you come by this scenario?
We're the experts.
Out of self comes selflessness.
In a way...
A free thinker.
McKinley?...McKinley?
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Look.
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
Care to indulge?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
Oh.
I'll leave you young things to it.
Oh, Oliver.
That's us.
I'm not going, Janet.
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
Mental instability?
What are you talking about?
Oh, Harry.
Mr.
Could I do that later?
But they only think they're happy.
I won't be a party to this.
It's only one night, Janet.
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Oh my poor baby.
Poor Brad.
You shouldn't have said that.
Hey!
I NEED SOME
No!  He's never done that before.
Just one or two details.
I'm...happy.
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
I want to see Brad.
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
. . .For his own good.
Brad!
BRAD!
Ah.
Our speciality.
HE!
Our field.
It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
That's an extremely negative response.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.
WHAT A JOKE...
THAT MINIMAL
CRIMINAL
This could be worse than the old series.
Hi!
And none of them worked?
Isn't she lovely?
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
You don't think I fuck you, bitch?
The fuck was that?
Don't bother him with that.
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Yeah.
So what's up?
Really?
Why are you being so defensive?
Miles.
Are you there? Miles?
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
What do you think?
How's it hanging, Miles?
You okay, Miles?
They're from both of us.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
Two years ago, buddy.
She was good for you.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Tastes good to me.
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
What happened to you guys?
Hi.
I can explain.
Hiya.
Highliner, please.
Are you a writer too?
That's hilarious.
Whatever you girls want.
Where the fuck were you, man?
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Oh, that's tasty.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
How old's she going to be?
Let me show you something.
This Saturday, Mom, remember?
Fuck, man.
It'd be the best thing for you.
You still seeing that shrink?
You know what?
Hey, Miles.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
This is rose, right?
What do you smell?
Huh.
That's what you do with every one.
How would you rate this one?
Are you chewing gum?
Hey Jack, hurry up!
I thought you said it was close.
Yeah. Tight.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Doesn't mean shit.
Jesus, she's jammin'.
Single.
Have you no shame?
So what're we going to have?
Nice, huh?
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
You gotta excuse him.
A bad girl, Miles.
Get the trunk.
We're on.
Stephanie, holy shit.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?
So what should I wear?
And don't drink too much.
Pull yourself together, man.
Where were you?
Stop it.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty.
Oh, hey, change of plans.
Later.
Oh, boy.
You should call her.
What'd Christine say?
Hey, there you are.
Where is Stephanie?
Does she know about Saturday?
Besides what?
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes.
I was hoping to get some understanding from you.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Nice shot.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Shut up!
What is it?
Fucker hit into us.
Just don't give up on Maya.
Is it the money thing?
We're on.
Yo!
So tell me everything.
You didn't get any, did you?
Did you have trouble performing?
This whole week has gone sour.
Do you like them?
How about this one?
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus.
Just write another one.
Well?
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday?
What's it look like to you?
You know what I'm thinking?
Fucking chick's married.
We gotta go back.
She tell you she was married?
So what's the plan?
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Yep. Quite a day.
Want me to drive?
Come on, let me drive.
What's wrong?
What the fuck!
Look at this!
You broke some.
Well. That about does it.
Love you, man.
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
You want to join us?
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Well, good to see you, Miles.
What are you drinking?
Nice. Very nice.
I'm having the salmon.
Are you all right?
Hi.
So what gems do you have in your collection?
Wow.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
You got kids?
So what's your novel about?
Bathroom over there?
Hope you like it.
Were you ever going to say anything?
Maya.
I've told him.
Please believe me.
Hi.
Hello?
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Where are you?
Hello?
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
That was big of him.
How much skin and stem contact?
Pour me a full glass.
Sir, what are you doing?
So what do you think?
Cabernet Franc.
What's everyone ordering?
Should we get dessert?
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
That was fun last night.
Where's Jack?
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
See you, Miles. You take care.
Stephanie! Stop!
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
It was a surprise, Mom.
You talked to Wendy?
Houdini's sick.
What's the matter?
What are you thinking about?
It makes me feel better.
There's dust in it.
Daddy.
I think it's contaminated.
It's not contaminated.
Not English though.
Listen Bo.
The same windows.
I don't want you to die.
I'm scared.
Hi sweetie.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
Does it hurt?
And tell Merrill to swing away.
You do?
Five. The five longest.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us.
Explain, act crazy?
I cursed.
It was very dark.
It was very dark.
That roof is over ten feet high.
Pharmacy crowded?
It's noise.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
Morgan, be careful.
Do you think it's a possibility?
Do you feel comforted?
For the kids protection.
Where are you going?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Chicken Teriyaki.
Should we turn off the lights?
They're on the roof.
This is going to do nothing.
He was only a year and half old.
Merrill --
Merrill!
They're distracting us?
I can feel air.
They're broadcasting...
How many died?
No.
He's been like that for awhile.
That's good enough for me.
Don't touch him.
Graham.
It's still making the noises.
We might lose the signal.
I'm getting out now.
Morgan?
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
Tell me something Morgan.
They said one of two things could happen.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
What about Isabelle?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Stop crying!
They'll read our minds!
I can't even imagine.
Did someone save me?
It's the strangest thing Father.
You said something was strange. What's strange?
It's not broken.
Second thing this week I can't explain.
You can't describe him at all?
Let me ask you two something.
I don't think so.
Is anything missing?
And three weeks.
There was an accident.
Is he okay?
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Is that him?
Don't do it!
I wouldn't do that.
I'd get down if I were you.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
All I did was kiss a girl.
Well, no, not exactly.
I think we lost 'em.
Forget the money.
Emmett.
I didn't know you were out.
Forget it.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
...Gotta go...
Where are we?
This was my father's.
I gotta get to my brother.
I'll go.
I almost didn't.
Kate?
Gotta go.
More than enough.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
Are you all right?
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too.
Offend anybody lately?
Jefferson City?
I gotta be going.
What's Turley like?
Doesn't look quite fair.
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
You'll have to deal me out on that.
Then I guess this is where we part ways.
Where you been?
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett.
I'll see you around.
You might make a farmer yet.
Daddy?
Where is Rae?
That's a lie.
He acted bravely out there, Hannah.
A lot of men have told me that.
J.
Augie's going to grow up here.
It was not -- it was Murdo's.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
That's the longest I ever did it.
Where's your brother?
This a friend of yours?
Get out of here, Jake.
New record.
Kelly, get over here.
You wanted to see me?
What are you talking about?
What's all this then?
Now let's talk about you chaps.
The jury saw it differently.
Hello, Rae.
He was murdered.
What are you doing here, Rae?
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Why him?
This is it, gents.
Why are they doing this, Mal?
I got there just short of too late.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
He must be pretty good.
Things are getting messy around here.
Hello, Cobb.
I see you're prospering without me.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
This is mighty sweet, Paden.
You got a place to stay?
What brings you into my saloon?
Nothing like that will happen between us.
I took out thirteen dollars.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
What is it you want from me?
I'm going to have to look into this.
You gotta calm down, Paden.
I never could count on you to be reasonable.
What a waste.
You work here?
Nifty.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
My compliments to you, Miss Stella.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner.
Is this a fair mix?
What's this?
You really are a gambler.
Where's the dog now?
What is it that I can't figure?
What makes you say that?
How about you?
I've got a place I can hide her.
It's an advance.
-- Forgive me, Mr.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
Of course she is.
No!
God, Viktor.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
You're not renewing my contract.
Where is she?
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
Stunning, Viktor.
I got them to remove the reflection.
Maybe you're right.
-- You can't go in there!
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
I'll tell you what.
She was there.
-- Viktor, are you with her?
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
My two favorite girls.
... Simone.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
-- She already is.
This is crazy.
Thank you!
Don't look so glum, Viktor.
Hello?
Mom, do you miss Dad?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
Let's go, Lainey.
God, it's so like your father.
You had no choice, Elaine.
Thank God for you, Faith.
What?... What did you say?
"Why are we here?
Don't I know it.
No, I'm okay.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
How will you do our love scenes?
Hal, what are you doing?
Is she here?
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
No.
-- Mr.
It's me, Mr.
You have to see her.
You already do.
Harry!
Hi, Dad.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.
Hi, Dad.
Your mother couldn't make it?
Not quite how I imagined it --
She's a miracle, Dad.
Can't you stop that?
Okay, Dad.
One thing bothered me.
Good-night, Daddy.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
I love you, Lainey.
Why didn't she thank you?
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
-- I can't accept it.
About you and mom?
-- No!
Do I know you?
So they're probably here.
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.
Nice boat, Taransky.
It's bogus.
I've done my homework.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
What now, Sayer?
I traced her to a nursing home.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Is it a jamming device?
Am I wasting my time with you?
Mr. Sayer...
-- I've been here before!
It's a hotel.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
I beg you.
Thank you.  It's not important.
Would you like me to read?
You know you're really very good.
Hi.
Simone, are you there?
Let's take it down a notch.
Good morning, Simone.
You mean they buy it?
Maybe he can.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
You did create me.
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood.
Mahogany.
Wow. They called you their son.
--My God.
Are you calling me?
Why, Malcolm?
Why did you leave me?
I just needed to do a couple of things.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
You know that's probably not the best idea.
Your eye frames.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
What were they hiding from?
I forgot your name.
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
I'm going to see you again, right?
We were supposed to draw a picture.
Everybody got upset.
You want to ask me a question?
Where should I look then, Cole?
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
He hates me.
You said the "s" word.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
What'd you write?
Think about what you want from our time together.
That isn't magic.
I didn't know you were funny.
Your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
What makes you think that?
I don't know how the story ends.
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
How often do you see them?
...No.
Did you think the play sucked big time?
Yes?
When they get mad, it gets cold.
Can I ask you then?
I have to.
I'm going to transfer you.
--What?
Don't cry.
Dr. Crowe?
Something happened, didn't it?
You really look better.
It's Spanish.
Just help.
I believe both of you now.
What if they don't want help?
I wish I were somewhere else.
Don't go home, okay?
I think we said everything we needed to say.
You were great in the play, Cole.
They're right here.
What are you thinking, Momma?
It was Grandma's.
You didn't take it before.
There's only two of us.
I'd give anything to have been there.
Communicate?
You know that accident up there?
You can see her?
Where is she?
Cole, you're scaring me.
You see ghosts, Cole?
What are you thinking, Momma?
Cole, that's very wrong.
She wanted me to tell you--
Yes, Cole?
That's not correct.
Cole, this was a legal courthouse.
I don't know how else to look--
Excuse me?
What--
How did you--?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!
...He doesn't get invited places.
Good for you.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Just talked to Orwell down at the garage.
Yo.
Okay, Farm Boy.
Get off his case sweetie.
Bitch.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Let me guess.
Hi.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Aha. The Lovers.
Suzie???
Looks like the alternator.
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
Dammit, Carl!!!!
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
Come on --
Carl, what are you doing?
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
Gene.
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
Wait a second.
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
"Peggy-Sue" --
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
Curt Cobain.
Well, there goes our record deal.
You're out of your mind, man.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Are you crazy?
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
So... what does it do?
Should we be doing this, dude?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
"With a hack-hack here --"
He means moon shining.
Yeah, man.
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
I came back for the funeral.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
How... was she "called?"
That old barn.
You got it wrong, boy.
Old slave superstition.
You'll be back.
You like it?
Then who?
It's time to make amends.
Throw me one.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
Never heard of it.
Is that all you ever think of?
Ow!
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Hey.
Yeah.
It's a farm, Keith.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Asphyxiation.
You wanna know the difference?
Shit!
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
Yeah. That's just the problem.
You guys figure it out.
How does it feel, Keith?
Time for a little.
What about Jeremiah?
What's wrong?
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald.
Think of it.
We're almost ready.
How'd you get that?
You wouldn't understand.
Suzie --
You're... limping.
Suzie... No.
No Mac, please... I --
Mac... let's get out of here.
Get out of here.
The trap door.
...no... Mac... p-please...
I almost thought for a second...
Yeah.
Hey.
What is it?!!
Hold it, hold it.
-- Where have you two been?
Where's Mac?
Carl.
Someone better tell Mac.
It gets worse.
Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
Shit.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece.
How are you going to find him?
That young lady heard you say 'squid.
What?
Don't worry.
What you up to?
Pretty, ain't they?
There's a place over there on the bluffs.
Grant, where'd you go?
How about Brenda?
Bill, I heard what you're doing.
Wait!
Please, Bill.
No reception out here.
Grant used to get filled up every day.
What are you doing?!
I'll get it for you.
Please, Starla.
What's she see in that douchebag?
He's gotta be in the forest.
Where are you?!
He's a fucking Martian?!
What the hell are we going to do?!
What?
Rorschach.
Looks like a chipmunk.
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Are you nodding?
Hey there, Chief.
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Who's the lucky fella?
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Grant?
Meat.
Sure thing, killer.
Hell, what am I holding back for?
He's teaching environmental science, Grant.
Flip.
Where are you going?
I never danced in a towel before.
Welcome home.
Yeahhhh.
What are you doing?
Who's that?
Grant.
I'll get if for you.
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
But not always.
Now he's here.
He took him over.
Ain't no mystery to it.
So he drags the cow backwards here.
Where'd he go?
Praise Jesus.
Maybe you better sit back down.
Get your hands off my daughter!
What's he get if he wins here?
You're crazy, man.
You got my barley pop?
Okay.
Kate McConnell.
Why're you driving so fast?
So tell me about yourself.
Well?...
Where you from?
Guess what?
What the hell's going on?
Anything?
Can I ask you something?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
That's a Texas cop.
Well?
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Christ, what channel are we on?...
The bus'll pick you up over there.
Jesus!!!
See ya, Kate.
What the hell are you doing?!?
You know this guy, don't you?
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
Mississippi's the other way!
Let's hit it.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
An unmarked police car.
I'm proud of you.
Kate...
My very words.
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
Why are you stopping?
One to five?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
What can I say?
He's just exhausted.
What are you thinking?
See ya, Bandit.
Why should I?
I'm working, Bandit.
What's your pleasure?
Order up!
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Cledus.
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
How long's this gonna take?
What are you doin' now?
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
Loud and clear.
He's history.
Shit! No one's here.
Liquid gold.
You know how to drive one of these things?
Hit the brakes!
Let's get the hell outta here.
We still on schedule?
I hate to say I told you so.
Bandit I, do you copy?
You can't swear on these.
This is Bandit II.
Bandit?
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
Never mind. It's nothing.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
-- How we doing?
Talk to me.
I'm all ears.
Bandit II?
How's the clock, Bandit II.
Are you loco, pardner!
Breaker. Breaker.
Breaker. Breaker.
Breaker, Breaker.
I think you're just yellow.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Have any trouble getting here?
This is Bandit I. Over.
Shut up, Fred.
Bandit II.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
Bandit two, you read me?
Is that Bandit in the lead?
Five thou.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
Right now?
Anything on the Swede?
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel.
Unreal, this guys jacket too.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller.
He's giving them up?
What about the sheriff's task force?
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
Maroon uniforms?
How bad?
Did he give you his name?
Who?
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right.
And this is your car, isn't it?
...I forgive you Darwin.
Really?
Man, that's great.
Are you on a land line?
I've got concerns.
I'm here, where's the car?
What happened?
His law firm, same one that hired me.
So I guess you're not going.
Yeah, we've been through that.
D'you talk to'm?
What'd you say?
Jesus Hugo!
About what?
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
I could have it sent out...
Do you want me to say I did it?
...I'm sorry...
Answer your fucking pages!
Fifty grand gouge.
That's probably him now...
FUCK YOU!
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
It's the last place they'd look.
Here. Sit.   Please.
What the hell -- What is this!
Where's Israel?
I can't discuss --
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
...Does he know?
...When did you know all this?
...Are you insane?
You're trying to save Sparazza?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
No question, no, you're right.
... Jesus... what for?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
So how we lookin'?
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass.
We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise.
Why?
Nuthin', we cool.
You got the fifty up?
...So you heard from Keith?
What'd you say?
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
What's wrong?
I DON'T KNOW!
Bulllllshit...
Gibarian.
What happened to Gibarian?
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
No.  There's no behavior modification.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
You killed her!
You murdered her!
She'll come back.
It's changing characteristics.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
I can't talk just now.
Is there anybody else here?
Tell me.
How much sleep do you need?
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
Personally, I think it's God.
She has materialized from your memory of her.
What will you say?
Kelvin, you awake?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?
We can liquidate the station.
They come when you sleep.
What happened?
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
What do you want?
Who are you trying to please?
What's wrong with you?
When did this happen?
Oh, God.  I'm awake.
I need to see Snow.
Don't.
What are they?
We're taking a flight?
Rheya...
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
Not a very happy poem.
You want to fuck her?
You're better when you take them.
What do you remember?
Is it a planet?
What happened?
Where've you been?
Scared.
What happened to us, exactly?
Why did you say those things?
I like that too.
What does Snow think you should do?
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
What's wrong.
What are you talking about?
Who have you been talking to?
But we fought.
Can you sleep?
You're the coward.
You don't want me.
Do you want to stay here?
What's wrong?
What's happening to us?
That won't happen again.  We're different.
How could it be so cruel?
I'm not Rheya.
Don't do this.
What do I have to do to stop it?
Is that really what you want?
What are you taking?
What does it want?
Where did you go before?
How can you be here...
He won't do it.
We thought you'd be alone.
A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
Gibarian was under enormous --
Snow, get up here, now.
I got rid of him.
You want it coming back with us?
Claire!
Skiddy and Kit?
It's terrific Win.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Straight ahead.
Hi.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
What did he say?
You live in Manhattan?
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Are you nervous?
Would you pick one out, please?
Put it on my account, please.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.
Hi.
You all right?
Claire?
Didn't do very well, did you?
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
Yeah.
What about Neil?
Good night, Mike.
Claire?
You put me life in danger.
You told me I'm safe?
Stop, will you?!
Yeah.
I don't know you...
You told her?
You don't want to know.
Where?
When can I see you?
Oh yeah.
Claire...
What a memory.
They guys treatin' you all right?
It wouldn't work.
I'd miss my life...
How long you going away for?
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
... Mike.
Claire!
Everyone's all right...?
So.
You still going away?
I'll miss you, Mike.
I like your coat.
Say goodbye, Mike.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
... just saying you should think twice about it...
You're dealing with a psychopath.
Keep what handy?
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Tommy...!
Mike?
So how'd it go?
For how long?
Changing the sparks.
Hey.  The neighbors.
I read the article.
Okay?
Honey.  You got him.
Bought it.
Coming to bed?
What?
Mike, take it easy...
I'm sorry.
C'mon, don't make an issue of it.
You gotta get another tour.
What did you do tonight?
Let me drive...
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
Ellie...
He doesn't want to sleep here.
Why not Patrol?
What about when she goes out?
But I got him!
They're operating on him.
What do you think?
At my house...!
Let's go.
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!
Who's Joey Venza?
Shit!
Not Koontz.
Wasn't your fault.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
Are you in charge here?
You're here 'til what time?
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan.
Hold it...!
How do I know that's her?
Under the table.
Watch your step!
What're we having?
How do you know where the gun is?
God!
Nice threads Dad.
How are things going, pal?
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
You coming in?
Tommy!
Sexual tension...
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Well, look who's dressing for success.
And Flash isn't?
Peter-- you took this picture?
Here you go, Pete.
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
I was there.
Lizzy!
Hey, guys.
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
Flash, get lost.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
What's in there?
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times.
Great idea.
You're so responsible it's disgusting.
Jesus Christ.
You get mugged or something?
Now tell me you love me.
Are you okay?
How are you doing, kid?
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Come on, that's pure luck!
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Can't focus...
Relax, Jameson.
Thank you.
Oh, that?
No refund on the mask, y'know.
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Are you quite finished?
He left.
Maybe I was hiding.
Good morning, Liz.
It's never too early to be clever.
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
My my.
I suppose.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
What are you doing this weekend?
Eat alone, gotta read.
Brrr.
Don't misquote Othello at me.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
May's much better.
Peter?
Hello, Liz.
Hold it.
You were the last one to see Thorkel.
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Toxic dumps, huh.
Of course.
Yeah, Roz.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
I am old enough to--
It's Friday night...
The record--
What the hell is that?
Oh, not that.
Absolutely no class.
A match made in heaven.
Peter, you're bleeding.
Poison emergency.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
You've used up your grant.
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
My self.
Creation? Or its opposite?
Otto, we are mere mortals.
Life and death matter.
Mr. Parker.
Peter, what can I do for you?
Fortean phenomena.
Need any more help?
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
Kid, you were terrific.
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?
Where'd you get the clown suit?
So they're airing this tonight?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
You're sure you're all right.
Do you... live around here?
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Up here, Docky Ocky!
Don't let him kid you.
What's wrong with him?
Jawohl.
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
Where's Hoffy?
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
Come on!
Ready?
There's only one pair left.
What's the matter?
I understand how you feel, Cookie.
So long, Cookie.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Hold it, Sefton.
Private property, bub.
Come on, Trader Horn!
Nice guy!
What's your beef, boys?
Static is right!
I grease the Kraut guards.
Yeah, what about it?
What are you looking at him for?
Have a cigar.
I wouldn't worry about Schulz.
Here's the knife to do it with.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
Put me down for ten, you louse.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
Come again?
Break it off!
How did he get over there?
The S.
Then we're all in on it?
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Cut out the guff, Schulz.
Come on, Schulz!
That's the general idea.
Lieutenant Dunbar?
Maybe he would.
What did you expect, glamor boy?
Let's blow, Chauncey.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
You are being rude again.
I didn't do it.
Here we have a typical barrack.
What do you do for heat in this barrack?
Well, Herr Inspector!
You were saying --?
Very well.
Aufstehen, gentlemen!
Jawohl!
Wisecrackers?
Hey, Schulz!
Why don't we accept, Animal?
What is this? This is water?
Shut up, Animal!
Good morning, Animal!
Hey -- Russki -- Russki!
Look at me!
Let me go! Let me go!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
Animal!
No, Animal.
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Don't you remember, Animal?
Thanks.
Ain't that too bad!
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Equipoise!
Schnickelfritz!
Look at her!
To the Brick Kremlin!
Harry -- I'm blind!
What do those broads say?
Hey!
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Grable, not Gable!
Do Grable.
I'll open mine now.
May I have this dance, Miss?
But it's not just those legs.
Betty! Betty!
Let me do it, Hoffy.
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
Good evening, Sergeants.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Wait a minute.
Don't worry.
You're wasting your time, Duke.
Not yet.
Cut the horseplay, Harry.
It's not Schulz.
What are you going to do?
What about Schulz?
No volunteers, Price.
We've all done a poor job of it.
What do you say, Hoffy.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
We know!
You must get out.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Anybody call?
What's the big idea, Sefton?
Lay off, Sefton.
What's the matter, boys?
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
You heard that, Sefton?
Hurry up on that trap.
How do they know?
Go on.
What are we going to do with him?
You taking Dunbar?
You could use a new one yourself.
Today's Camp News!
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Yeah?
Now you've done it.
And what's that crack supposed to mean?
So was the radio private property.
Or how about a game of pinochle?
Ach so!
Stop that, will you!
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
The what?
Let us see.
Which one of us is the informer?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Good morning, Sefton.
No use, Schulz.
Du lieber Gott!
Wunderbar!
Three hundred cigarettes!
I'll make it five hundred!
What's the matter with you?
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
This is me in Cincinnati.
All right, gentlemen!
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
From a chicken, bug-wit.
Is it all right if we smell it?
You must have been some tail gunner!
Have a nice time over there?
So you're stuck with me, eh?
You heard him.
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
It's working.
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Where is he now?
Target their Bridge.
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump.
Captain=8A
But that wasn't so long ago.
Data?
Data, are you all right?
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome.
This is its current position.
Courage is an emotion too, Data.
That's where he's going.
Are any of them inhabited?
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms.
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
Is she still angry?
Well?
I get it. I get it.
What?
Data, this isn't the time.
Data, are you all right?
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Can you locate them?
We're within range, sir.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
You did it, Kirk!
Do you remember him?
Guinan.
Guinan, what's going on?
This is the Nexus?
Guinan, what are you doing here?
These are my children...my children.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
I'm Captain John Harriman.
Well, may we have a look around?
Prepare to leave spacedock.
We don't have a tractor beam.
What about the gravimetric distortions?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
You said history considers me dead.
No, no, it's not.
Antonia?
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise.
Oh
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
But I do have a theory...
Keep her together until I get back.
Kirk here.
I don't want a science lecture.
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Imagine what it was like, Will.
Sir?
There is something else, Captain.
Report.
Maybe they're not out there.
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Captain, are you all right?
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Captain, Im sorry.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
Doctor Soran?
Nothing for me.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
We're all mortal, Soran.
Careful, Captain.
The royal...studs?
It looks like we're too late.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes.
Status!
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Steady.
What's going on?
Mr. Chekov -- ?
Will we get another ship?
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Unit two, this is One.
Calm yourself, Bones.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Still no response, sir.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
Aye sir, coding now.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Sir.
Could it be Spock's?
I don't believe it...
Why don't we beam it up?
All right -- get your gear.
Hello, sir. It's David.
David, I don't understand...
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk.
Saavik to Grissom.
.          .. Spock's tube...
Well.
What is it?
Later. Let's go...
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
It's time for total truth between us.
This planet is aging in surges.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
Grissom to landing party.
Captain, this is Saavik.
Captain, this is Saavik.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Captain, what's happening?!
I'm almost done, sir.
Mr. Scott...
As promised, she's all yours, sir.
Mr. Scott?
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
Mr.
Good shooting, Scotty.
How many more?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
What happened...?
The Genesis planet is gone.
Yes, Admiral.
My God...
I know you... Do I not?
Yes, yes, Spock...
On course, Admiral.
The word, sir?
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
See! That shimmering area.
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
Klingon Bird of Prey, sir!
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
We are clear and free to navigate.
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Would you look at that?
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Will you be able to handle that...?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Where's Doctor McCoy?
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Yes.
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise.
Do not lecture me about treaty violations.
David?... David!
There are two more prisoners, Admiral.
Commander, Klingon vessel.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Genesis, I want it.
Give me your hand and we both live.
... He spoke of your friendship.
Please wait!
Bones!...
What about Spock?
So!  Speak!
Share this with no one.
Sir, may I suggest --
I ordered no interruptions.
We are cloaked.
Why haven't they finished us?
How can you tell that?
I give two minutes.
I'll be in my quarters.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Firing range, sir.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
500 Kellicams!
My Lord... what are your orders?
You amaze me, Commander.
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?
Physician, heal thyself.
Romulan Ale!
I'm almost afraid to.
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Slide them down your nose.
Shore leave, Admiral.
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
It never rains but when it pours --
I've got the sick bay ready.
Doctors lose patients sometimes.
Khan could be down there!
They even killed the galley chief.
Go?
But what if they went -- nowhere?
Do you have anything to eat?
Now that's what I call a meal.
Until now.
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
... come in, please.
I still don't under --
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov.
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
Wait --
David was right, wasn't he?
You did this -- in a day?!
Well, don't have kittens.
Does that about do it?
Will you please be quiet!
I've tried to warn you.
David --
Jim --
So are we, it looks like.
This?
David. Please.
Don't tell me you've got something.
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
You're crazy -- !
I told you!
But the child --
He left us.
You lie!
Khan, listen to me!
Well done, Commander.
I'm Admiral Kirk...
Where's Dr. Marcus --
Why didn't you tell me?
It's a long story.
It's the Genesis Wave!
I don't mean to intrude.
I suppose I was.
I was wrong about you.
Let go -- he can't -- !
What are you looking at?
Steady on course. All systems normal.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Careful: Not all at once.
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
They won't --
At them!
Well?
Departing dark side, Regula.
We'll lose them if they go in there.
No sir!
Tactical!
Yours... is... the superior...
You still remember, Admiral.
Genesis, what's that?
Thirty seconds...
Time's up, Admiral...
Kirk!
Goodbye, Admiral.
I don't know you.
Captain.
An emergency situation has arisen.
Scotty -- what's left?
Just barely, sir.
Uhura. Can't you augment?
She's not responding...
Mr. Scott on discrete.
On screen.
... No response, sir.
Mr.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
<u>WHY</u>?
No, sir!
Yes, Spock.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
Spock, this is Kirk.
And who is this?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
Is the word given?
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
I know of your fondness for antiques.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Something may be wrong at Regula I.
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
Carol Marcus --
It literally is Genesis...
Gentlemen, this isn't --
What's she doing here?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
They knew just where to hit us.
Not enough against their shields.
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
The prefix code?
Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination.
Scanners and sensors still inoperative.
All right, join the party.
What IS working around here?
Uh oh.
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft.
Spock!
... the good of the few...
Kirk here.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
Any suggestions, Admiral?
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
May I speak, sir?
That was a little joke.
Yes.
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
Khan!
Reliant's command...
On screen...
Indeterminate life signs.
That's true, Admiral.
It doesn't make sense.
Admiral?
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
How?
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
That was close --
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Time from my mark...
Time!
Admiral on the bridge!
I really must thank you.
Stop engines.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
I can't get power, sir!
Sir, you did it.
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Admiral on the bridge --
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
Shields activated!
We're over our heads.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Prepare for warp speed.
We commend the soul of our brother departed.
Fire all phasers...!
He's not what I expected, Sir.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
Certainly...
You lied.
I do not understand the final question...
Heard there was some excitement.
How're you doing?
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
You -- sent them away.
No!
You sure this is such a bright idea?
Bones --
Bones, stay here.
Now wait just a damn minute.
I prefer a dose of common sense.
It doesn't look all that different.
Oh, joy.
What did you say she was getting?
An experimental device, doctor.
Wake up, man, wake up!
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Congratulations, Jim.
Hi... Busy?
Most unusual.
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
10 million years earlier.
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
... I don't think he understands...
You're saying... It is a compliment.
Who are you?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What's your degree in, dentistry?
What's causing that!?
Damage report!
Find it?
Team leader, this is team 2.
How long?
My name is Pavel Chekov.
Operational, Admiral.
No, sir.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
No choice now, Scotty!
Yes, sir.
Ah, well done, team 2.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
The mains are down, sir!
Status report, Admiral!
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
Attempting the hell to communicate.
They like you very much.
So you were at Berkeley.
You sure you won't change your mind?
You mean man...
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each.
Ohhh<u>kay</u>.
Back to San Francisco.
Thanks.
Memory problems, too.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
All right.
Just a little joke.
Do you trust me?
Thanks. Cheers.
Where could you take them?
What's that?
Wanna try it from the top?
Sorry, that's classified.
It's true... what you said...
Steady, now. We need your help.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
You tricked me.
Oh my God, we're too late!
... What does that mean?
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Permission to come aboard.
Where are you going?!
Spock...?
Mr. Spock, your computations?
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
Earth... But when?... Spock?
Home in on the strongest signal.
There is a 20th Century possibility.
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Spock...
It's her -- from the Institute.
I meant --
Status?
Admiral. Full power is restored.
Mr.
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
Spock: Condition report!
You got us to the right place, Spock.
Guidance is functional.
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Warp two... three...
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
Aye, sir. Descending.
Ready sir.
Maintaining impulse climb.
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
10 seconds, sir!
I have no control, sir!
Systems report.  Communications?
What is it?
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
We'll stick together till we get orientated.
Any luck...?
Bearing!
Estimate range, ship to whales!
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
We're ready, sir.
Scotty, how long is this bay?
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
What is it?
It's going slow, sir.
I'm ready Spock.
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
Admiral! There be whales here!
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Ironic.
You better get up there, sir.
The whales...?!
Excelsior?
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
Don't know anything about it?
Professor Scott, if you'll --
With pleasure.
Hello? Computer...?
Transparent aluminum?
Hi.
Father...?
Ojichan?
Chotto omachi nasarei.
You have warp capability?
I understand how you feel.
I know what a hologram is, Captain.
Deceive us?
Don't panic...
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
There's one thing I don't understand.
Jak'tahla?
How is it a woman like you never married?
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...?
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
There is no need for concern.
Not everyone here agrees with him.
Don't you ever get tired?
Chase me!
Anij!
I have to go home now.
Can he breathe under water?
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined.
Very funny...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Will he live?
She's stabilizing.
Hello, Data...
Yes... that looks like them.
A ship,
Incomplete, I might add.
How many?
Take us into a high orbit.
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral.
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
I'll order Riker to turn around.
You're not going to launch anything until...
I do not take orders from you.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
All right.
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
Gallatin!
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault.
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner.
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
Implants bothering you?
Funniest thing, Captain.
A photon torpedo.
Full impulse.
Will that stop the tear?
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
Aye, sir.
I don't think they believe us.
What's inside that nebula cluster?
They're powering their forward weapons array.
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Who is it?
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Deck five.
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
My name is Sojef, Captain.
Bridge to Captain Picard.
I.
Worf to Picard...
Worf, you must hurry...
Captain...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Scanners are off line!
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
You need a haircut, Commander.
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir.
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
One. It's Ru'afo.
... Population three hundred million...
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians?
Counselor?
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
Why would we be involved with these people?
You haven't done that in a long time...
Come in.  Hi.
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Both.
Augh.
All hands. Battle stations!
Initiate launch sequence.
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
Montana.  Energize.
Go where?
It's Cochrane.
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
He's stable.
I have to go back to the silo.
You actually performed surgery...?
But I had a little help.
How long has he been unconscious?
Is it Japanese?
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating.
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
You've taken your first step toward perfection.
Do you know what this is, Data?
No. I will not betray my friends.
Have you ever know a woman?
Yes...
I've deactivated the sensory inputs.
Isn't it better like this...?
There is a perimeter alert.
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
Dispersive armor is holding.
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
I have helm control.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
What year is it?
Who are you?
The planet's surface is covered with Borg technology.
Did you know her?
Data... are you sure you're all right?
No.
"APR cell count?
Juice?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
What did you do to the batteries?
I have the silo, sir.
This must be it.
Alphanumeric lock.
Blast door.
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.
Maybe.
Ready to make a little history?
We can't leave her out there.
Captain --
No... the door's too thick.
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
The Vulcans should be out there right now.
Passing one-half light speed.
There's no temporal shielding in here!
Captain, the Enterprise!
Their com system must still be down.
Are we on schedule?
ATR setting...
Oh.
Where in the States?
Where are you from most recently?
You seem to have an answer for everything.
What do you want?
There is no invasion...
From another planet.
Take care of him.
What are you, an idiot?
Cochrane?
Did you need something?
"Money.
No.
What?
Were the two of you... involved?
I'd say you already have.
Okay, let's hear it.
Why are you being so difficult?
You're leaving, aren't you?
Signal the Endeavor to fall back.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Life signs?
Captain...?
Track their weapons fire.
Port battery, ready sir!
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere.
Target locked!
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
Report.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Captain?
Good luck, sir.
Return to our own time?
Yes, sir.
Casualties are light, Captain.
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
What the hell is happening, Worf?
What are they doing?
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
We have to stop them from sending that message.
Are you alright?
Worf!
Report!
Report.
Someone...?
They're bypassing Engineering...
To do what?
I remember it made me sick.
Worf to Bridge.
Worf to Bridge.
Worf? Is something wrong?
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
No response.
Even Data?
Mr. President.
Good luck, Captain.
I believe the operation is over.
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Spock, that was actually funny.
Or not to be -
Uh, Jim...
What the Hell's going on?
Sweet Jesus...!
No!
Thanks...
Figures.
Three months till retirement.
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
What is it with you, anyway?
What kind of creature is this?
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
ARE YOU CRAZY?
Damned clever if you ask me...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time.
We're explorers not diplomats!
This is fun...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
Are you carrying a surgeon?
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
I was nervous -
They'll respect him now...
It takes a lot of effort.
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
Would you care to go topside?
My God, what happened here?
He's a DOCTOR!
What?
Are those your words?
You were demoted...
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Just the size of my head -
Torpedo room--?
From Starfleet?
Where IS the conference?
She's here - somewhere.
Shields. Battle stations.
Mr.
Course heading, Captain?
They're preparing to fire.
You're forgetting something.
Klingon blood.
Aye, sir.
An INCIDENT?
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
Thank you, Captain Kirk.
An accident wasn't good enough...
Your friends are late...
Isn't it about time you became something else?
What took you so long?
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
How did you know...?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
How much time's left of your sentence?
That's not his knee.
Listen.
I know how to get outside the shield.
Stand down your weapons.
This is incredible -
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Aft thrusters -
Aye, sir.
Sorry -
Uhura, hailing frequencies.
I hope you're happy.
Captain, our shields -- !
Who is "US?"
Just the prototype.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
I'm getting underway now.
Me?
WE volunteered?
Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.
Never been this close.
What is it?
What the -
We HAVEN'T fired -
I am responsible for involving you in this.
Captain...
The peace conference.
I've been dead before.
Are you dining on worms?
I was blind.
Close enough to beam down?
What's she waiting for?
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Channel open, Captain.
Captain --
It's pretty chaotic over there.
Gorkon's own man??
Uhura?
You have done well, Saavik.
You must have faith.
How did you - ?
Her own father...?
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Any progress?
A lie?
If you are logical.
Direct hit -
Trouble?
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
Praxis?
NO WAY!
They dinna fire on themselves.
Too far off.
- could take weeks, sir.
They're outside the beaming shield.
They're naturally wary, ma'am.
And they'd be right.
Fuzzy face is gone.
Do you know who I am?
Do you know where you are?
Can you remember our father?
Brother. I cannot move.
When was he... created?
Beverly, come in.
Remember him?
I so wanted to believe Shinzon.
How long does he have?
But we do have one advantage.
To seek out new life and new civilizations.
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc.
So... To happy endings.
Sir.
He is very observant.
Data!
Data to Captain Picard.
My mission was a success, sir.
A bit less florid, Data.
A weapon.
Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
What do you imagine this is?
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
How long until we reach the fleet?
We are passing through the Bassen Rift.
We are losing dorsal shields.
We are being hailed.
Sir, allow me to go.
Why am I looking at me?
You have a red shirt.
Isolated pockets of humanoids.
At present he serves no useful function.
What purpose does this serve?
What is our approximate distance?
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
It's you.
No.
If you wouldn't mind.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
May I have this dance?
Counselor.
I'm going to miss you.
How can you be certain?
But how can he? He'll kill you.
I'm only half human.
Imzadi. This is so good.
I'll always be with you now.
You're not here.
No.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore.
Open a channel.
Cannon fodder.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse.
He's getting his cloak back.
What's he doing?
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.
How long until he can fire?
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
You have the bridge, Commander.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Geordi.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
I won't do it.
To find the head, sir?
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
No!
We're being hailed.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer.
What's this?
I think it's worth a look.
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
Why don't they answer our hails?
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Not very chatty.
Sir?
Strength in numbers?
Report.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
The Titan's a fine ship, will.
But she's not the Enterprise.
Serving with you has been an honor.
And you're not as we imagined you.
Praetor?
I want to end the centuries of mistrust.
No one knew what to do.
We need to talk, just you and I.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised.
It's not quite the face you remember.
You don't trust me.
I want to know  where I come from.
After you, Praetor.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
In time, Jean Luc.
Hello, Jean Luc.
What are you doing?
All of this so you could capture me?
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn.
Yes.
That's your life... not mine.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Report!
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Deploy the weapon.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
So theyve got him up and running.
My God...
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Intruder alert!
Are we prepared?
This is a mistake.
The bond is broken.
It's accelerating.
How long?
How long until we reach the Rift?
Praetor...
What is it?
Join us, Commanders.
How many Warbirds will you need?
Praetor.
You must learn patience, Commander.
The Enterprise is immaterial!
Commander Suran, the games are over.
Benny, God, take it easy...
Right in line with that burning tree.
Benny, there's nothing there.
What did I tell you?
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Mike, call for back-up.
Gate three. It's boarding now.
What can I do for you folks?
You have one with two beds?
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Food.
Do you have children?
What do you think of America?
No!!! No!!!
Where did you stop last?
We're going... Damn!
Recognize this?
It's real, George.
We'll need a lot of help, George.
Contain it and get back to me.
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
We're growing very concerned back here.
Hello George.
No deal.
George... Do you hear me, George?
Mrs. Haydn...
I won't let anyone hurt you.
This is Marc Shermin.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Mrs. Haydn...
Please...
Please.
Please...
What?
Ah... no...
Steering wheel...
Steering wheel.
What?!
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Which way?
What?
What?
What?
What?
Money.
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
What?
What?!
Minneapolis... good.
No gas.
No gas.
Go.
What?
Who is he?
Who are you?
That's a big help.
Gas.
No gas.
Who?
Shit.
Who?
In your pocket, please...
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
Money.
What?
What is...  ...Coke?
What's the matter?
Horses.
What?
That was a red light!
I will see it next time.
Why are you going here? What is here?
When do you have to be here?
Sun...
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
But I must go here.
Say it.
'Lathrop Wells, please.
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Don't worry.
Don't be afraid.
Well... I'm going to go now.
Jennyhaydn.
Goodbye.
What happened?
You thought we were a different planet?!
What are you doing?
Nobody knows.
I like this music.
Do you have music up there?
I am not a good singer.
Put that back.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff.
The machine gave me two.
Are you angry at me?
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
Where are you going?
Asshole!!
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
What are you saying?
You are cold.
What?
Good morning.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
Oh, you're pretty...
They are beautiful.
The cowboys were right.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
Here are two quarters.
This is crazy.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
This is yours...
How long will it take you to get home?
There.
The yellow one.
Where do you think you're going?
Well...
What do I do now?
I love you.
Tell the baby about me.
Help me!!
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Help me!!!
You sure this is your car?
I told you I'm looking for someone.
They after you?
The five-fifty.
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
I have nothing to do.
Is it for real?
This is crazy.
I know.
Tell him I'm not here.
You get that, Lyman?
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
This has always been my favorite time of day.
Oh, Jesus.
You married, Major?
Where are you going?
I don't understand.
Good job, neither do I.
I told you...
Is there a reward in this?
Hello...
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked.
Yeah, that's right.
Okay, let's get you wired up.
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.
Some tips.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
I made my choice, Lenny.
You can't just... kill him.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
Cut it out, Tran.
Faith, call me, okay?
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
You have to go.  I mean it.
You have to get out of here.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.
Who did it?
What's going on?
How did it happen?
I understand.  No, I'm not.
No.
Sounds good.
Bobbyyyy!
You were lucky, Max.
Naw.  She won't call me.
I just hate to see you pining away.
I'm telling ya, it's over.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
You alright?  Y'okay?
That's right.
Faith OK?
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
He's been cooked-off
Whattya mean?
Jesus.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
No.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
You just did.
So.
Wait a minute.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.
So there never was a death squad.
How did you hook up with Faith?
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
How'd you get the tape?
Give me six at least.
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?
Show a little respect, Nero.
About what?
Charm.
It's alright.  He means it.
Nero.
I don't like disappointments, Nero.
Greetings, gents.
Thanks for giving me a ride.
Jeez, you're pathetic.
So, what's up with you?
What's his name?
What the fuck are you doing?
Are we having a bad night?
Hey, careful on the jacket.
I need my case.
That would be no.
I thought we were friends.
Yeah.
Forget her.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
What is it?
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
And gives it to you.
Cause you're the man, right?
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
Uh unh.
Is this great fabric or what?
He knows what he's doing.
Don't crank the gain any more.
No more, Lenny.
She came to me for help.
She said "If they get me".
How's Zander?
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.
Whatup Lenny?
Where we going?
What is it?
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Think back about what she said.
Lenny, give them the tape.
Shit!
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
This is bad.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Those two guys were cops.
Tell me.
Hang on.
We got to make another copy of this.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
Who's Strickland?
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Okay, we gotta get over there.
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
Mace... you're a girl.
Got your ticket?
You see Tran?
Alright.  We're going up.
That's the original.  There are no copies.
Take it to him.
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
Are we under arrest?
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
Where were you Mom?
What is that?
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey.
No.
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
He's skull-fucking you, bud.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Was this him?
Have you had a chance to think about --
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
You run the plates?
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Agent Mackelway.
Hey, Sheriff.
The room key's in the car.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Dylan here.
You have the body?
The family has gone through a lot.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims.
Ripped off.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Jesus.
You... surprised me.
What are you...?
Look, mister...
My God.
Calm down, Harold.
I've been looking for you.
He was sitting here?
Speck's the killer all right.
You have the photo from the diner?
He said it was a clue?
Chuck, hello.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Mackelway, I could understand.
Look, sorry.
I think I talked to him.
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
How do you feel, Agent
I'll take it into consideration.
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Nothing concrete.
I got a look in Testa's computer.
Why did you go to Chicago?
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
Miss me, Dave?
Don't you touch him.
You are so fucked up.
Thanks for the ride.
You work with Koessler?
This is a sexy case.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
Yes I do.
Relax.
Look at this fellow... or this one.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
There are Agency regulations about this.
Find the feet?
Jesus.
The tattoo?
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
Mack, I'm sorry.
Maybe we should back off a bit.
There's the Agency issue.
Hello?
My watch.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
I met with Richard Low.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
But why this pattern?
Tom, you okay?
It's quite advanced.
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
Jaime --
What happened?
Agent...
Unlock these cuffs.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
Uncuff me.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
Bitch!
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Who are you?
Agent Mackelway?
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
What was your weakness, sir?
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
We're alike.
Is he dead?
Was it Zero?
[Reality very risky.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
I've been to Chicago.
Let's talk about Zero.
I've located the Suspect Zero file.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center.
Headed there now.
No.
"MyDick?"
But why attack an Agent?
How far is Amarillo?
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
I don't think you understand.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI.
You want to "profile" me?
Michael, this is Grandma.
You should call your Grandmother.
Don't do it, Mike.
How are you ladies doing this evening?
You like laughing at the misery of others?
Thanks.
Well, thank you...?
Hi.
What else?
Charles! What's up, man?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
They're out of Glenlivet.
Hi.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I know what you're saying, man.
It's like, you looked at my tape.
Let me just check on my boy.
Always...
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
Oh my God.
The poor thing. Six years?
He's so sweet. He really said that?
A couple of high rollers like you?
What do you guys do?
On the table.
Huh?
Do you have anything smaller?
Do you ever perform out here?
I'm sure she'll call.
Can I check my messages?
Sorry, it's just that...
You said there are advantages to being single.
Well... This is it.
You're a comedian?
Well, I should be getting...
Hello?
Hi. Sorry about that.
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
How's it going?
Hi.
You want to hit the town tonight?
How many strokes?
Kinda money, huh?
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
...What's the big deal?
What's that guy's name? Sue?
There are so many beautiful women here.
I'm going in.
Thanks, man.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden.
You want to talk about it?
Uuuuugh!
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Then why won't she call...?
You miss the pain?
You little bitch!
You should play another team.
It's kinda money, actually.
Pause it. 
What's he do?
...How can you compare them?
Who threw this party, anyway?
How's it going for you two?
She was cute.
He's a bitch.
You asshole.
Yeah.
You live in such a fantasy world...
I'm so sorry, man.
Good for you, man.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.

Are you ready to order?
Excuse me.
Hello?
That was Sue.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Vegas, baby!
Vegas.
Wake up, baby.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
This place is dead.
Cut that shit out.
That's where we make our scene.
Double down.
Mikey's the big winner.
What an asshole.
That was so fuckin' money.
Nice, baby.
Whatever.
Oh... a Dorothy.
What was the part?
Wait.
...So give me the fuckin part...
No, man.
She asked me what I was thinking about?
No.
You guys are such assholes.
What time's this party tonight?
Who? Rob?
...the Copa, in New York...
...Maybe.
How you guys doing?
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Was I money?
We got the digits, baby.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
How long do I wait to call?
So, two days?
What the fuck..?
You were off your ass back there!
It's not like that...
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Bitch... You little bitch!
Because he's a bitch.
...against the computer.
I don't know.
Is he cute?
What a surprise...
Oh, it's on, baby...
Is she looking at me, baby?
Yes she did.
That was pretty cold, dude.
It's on.
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...we're not...
...honestly...
...Tomorrow, then a day.
Definitely.
You dick.
...Anaheim...
...Sue...
It's on...
It's on.
It is on.
Sorry man.
The bear's got his claws back.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
And you?
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
No.  You ask for too much.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.
Be my friend.
What do you wish me to do?
Understood.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
Godfather!
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.
Don't be frightened.
What's the matter, Carlo?
What was that?
You're staying home.
The food is on the table.
You filthy guinea spoiled brat.
You heard about your father?
Clemenza.
You take care of Paulie?
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
We gotta fight sometime.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.
You look terrif on the floor!
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Outside.
I'll think about it.
Good for ten men...
You think we'll go for that last place?
My compliments.
You take care of your family?
You look terrible.
Is it necessary?
He's his own boss, and very competent.
It is Johnny.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
What is this nonsense?
What was this for?
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Barzini will move against you first.
Don Tommassino.
Things went badly in Palermo?
You tell us about America.
Hey, beautiful girls!
Get the car.
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.
Ever seen anything like that before?
Mike!  The party starting!
Who are those girls?
Mike, you sure about Moe selling.
Is the hospital covered?
What about Luca?
Was there a definite proposal?
One of Tattaglia's people?
Jesus, I don't know...
Kay, we weren't expecting you.
What was that?
Will you give this to him.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right?
Mr.
Hello Kay.
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
What about McCluskey?
Bookkeepers know everything.
I've never seen anything like it.
Michael, what are those men doing?
No.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
What will your father say?
Michael, what are you doing?
Michael?
Hello.  Kay?
I LOVE YOU.
I can't...
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty.
When will I see you again?
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?
Will you?
Michael, it's not true.
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
Where are you going?
Mikey, you look beautiful!
We can't wait.
Go on Mike.
O.
I'm glad you came, Mike.
We're going to New Jersey?
What is it?
Do you renounce Satan.
Do you wish to be baptized?
Let us fill up our Regimes.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
Mike, good to see you.
Buy me out?...
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.
You straightened my brother out?
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.
Yeah.
How do you do.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Tom was telling me about his trip over.
I'll do it.
What? What?
Uncanny!
Hi Tom.
Okay, we're going to Naples.
It'll just be for a little while.
He's drowning me!
Who's this?
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Who?
I'm intruding.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
I'm never going back!
You like jazz!
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
Good afternoon!
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
Could we sail to Venice?
You're breaking my ribs!
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.
I know. I write like a child.
Do you have any brothers?
Means we never shared a bath.
What does he say?
Shoes too?
What's the fight about?
She was pregnant.
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
What?
Frederico!
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Hello?
No.
You should watch that!
Freddie, do you have something to say?
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Mr Greenleaf.
Yes.
Tom.
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
I could probably see my bedroom from here.
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.
You were right about the telephones.
I never said that!
Which is ridiculous.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car!
That ring's so great. The green one.
I have to find a birthday present for Frances.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Are you okay?
Dickie!
Hello Marge.
Thanks.
He hates being confronted.
Oh my God. Tom.
Is he really not here?
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
Did he kill Freddie?
Where does Dickie live?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Look at me what?
Very.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Tom?
I found Dickie's rings.
Marge? Where are you going?
I told you. He gave them to me.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
Peter Smith-Kingsley.
No, we're meeting another friend.
We think he's had a change of heart.
So you found Peter...
Where's Dickie's father?
Is this you?
This is spectacular.
What's funny?
What's your secret?
I'm Meredith, by the way.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Show me the other one again.
Let's go.
C'mon, I need to talk to you.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
Will you meet me tomorrow?
Dickie, my God!
Of course. Aunt Joan.
So -- are you travelling under R?
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Ditto.
Yes, what happened?
Will we see you later?
Sorry, sorry.
My God.
Welcome to Venice.
In Rome, about three weeks ago.
I've been backpacking.
No.
What did he say?
I'm sorry.
Not guilty.
Are you okay?
Tom, are you okay?
Hello. What are you up to?
How was it?
Good things about Tom Ripley?
Dickie Greenleaf?
It's a terrible shock, eh?
Senta.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
Thank you.
You got a .44 Magnum?
How much for everything.
You in Nam?
Yeah.
You like ball games?
Is that so?
Why?
I don't know...
Com'on, Travis.
You're right!
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
What are you doing?
Damn.
Where are you going?
This is sort of high class...
...there's plenty of movies around here.
What about the record?
Hello, Travis.
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
How are you, Travis?
No, no, please.
Travis?
Tom, come here a moment.
Try holding the match like this.
Betsy, come over here a moment.
No, I don't think so.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
First she did her make-up.
Yeah, that's Blush-On.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
...he called up the Dispatcher last night.
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up.
Stick up?
Huh?
20 bucks?
Hello.
Why you hang around with them greasers?
What's your name?
Why? Who are you?
Can't you listen to me?
Listen...
Fuck it!
Do you understand why I came here?
Well, I tried.
Well, you want to or not?
Where?
God, you are square.
Who's a killer?
Sure you don't want to come with me?
Why should it be grounded?
Nice talking to you, Travis.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
So whatja do now?
You kiddin?
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Who?
Is that so?
Here, officer, take me in.
I'm no cop.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
Wha -- ?
Get it.
Travis.
So howsit?
What's the action around?
Wiz?
Had a close one.
Not really.
Could we change the subject?
Stick with Carla.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
No.
Maybe.  Not really.
Thank you.
Spit it out.
It's me sir.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
He's got a gun, sir.
Just come and get me, sir.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
I don't understand....
John Mason.
Motor oil?
Don't shoot me.
I.
Limp dick?
I'll go.
What are you doing?
Wait.
Mason.  Mason?
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?
Surprise, surprise.
Partners?
God's speed.
St.
Hi.
I believe you.
What about you, Delly?
You'll stand by me?
You've got everything?
Did you bring along something to read?
Not exactly light reading, I know.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
I see you got the telegram.
Dad?
How'd it go?
I think  it's worse  now.
He doesn't remember anything, Delly.
Do you... remember me?
What.
You can all go home, now.
City hall?
You first.
Right here.
We were in love... weren't we?
What was that?
Were we going to get married?
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
When did you start smoking?
They're not bad.
Now, did you remember that, or...
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Your dancing's very good.
What... do you remember?
Delly, shhhhhh...
Sir, that is true.
Yes... yes, I do.
All right, Mr.
Yes.  A prepared statement.
I'm a little hesitant to say.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Cecil!
Only one in town.  Get in, son.
Here we are.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
No wallet, huh?
Are you saying that he's...
Mother o'god...
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
Yes.
You never came back from the war.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
Wait'll you see the inside!
We've been closed for a while.
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
That's Lily.
They couldn't wait to see you.
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.
Um... Harry?
"February 10, 1942.
Yes?
But I...
Ernie.
Carl.
Well...
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Luke... what time is it?
Jesus...
I'm here.
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
Pete.
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
'Sides, car's right outside.
Any idea how you got here, son?
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
Here, one of mine.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?
What is it?
That's me and my daughter Adele.
That's where you live.
Evening, Luke.
What's wrong?
You kids off to the dance?
It's a pretty massive heart attack.
You smell gas?
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Peter, their hands are tied.
Next time, it might be the FBI.
That was quite a show you gave them today.
Cigarette?
When'd you quit smoking?
Peter, I'm an agent.
Her name was right there in front of them.
That was beautiful.
Sit.  Play with me.
Luke!
Is there a young Tim?
Found me.
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.
T-t-thank you.
That's my r-r-rent.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Please, sit.
They'll come back, you know.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
I'm.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
What happened?
Will you help me, Sandy?
Ancestors?
I suppose.  Thanks.
They all know you?
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.
You hungry, son?
Said as much myself, Doc.
Miss Hayworth?
Yes?
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Do I?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
Oh, hi!
I was wondering...
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Hi.
No, thank you.
Thank you.
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
I guess you knew that, anyway.
Do you think I should go?
Is anyone there?
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco.
Yes, I did.
Mother!
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
They haven't harmed anyone.
Miss Daniels?
They're beautiful!
Is smoking fun?
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Mitch?
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Mitch, let's turn back.
Mitch?
What?
Good morning.
Do you know him?
See where I'm pointing?
I wonder if you could tell me...
Are you sure?
How much for the phone calls?
Mrs.
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
What good'll that do?
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
Gulls!
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
Here's your pie, Sebastian.
I thought I saw your car.
How do you do, Miss Daniels?
Oh. I see.
You did say birds?
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
Tell him about the party.
I don't know.
Mother!
Mitch...
Mother, get a rope!
I can handle it.
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
They're gone. The same pattern.
No, it's me, Mrs.
Where's Mitch?
Do you think Cathy's all right?
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
I miss him.
That's the last of it.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Does this room look silly?
He was killed last night. By birds.
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
He won't be back until Monday.
Well, where did he go?
I wonder if you could help me.
Yes, I see.
What did you say?
I don't know you.
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
What's that?
So you're a lawyer.
Ouch!
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
Can't see a thing.
Yes, but...
With... with Annie, of course.
Hi.
Why did he shoot her?
I'd still like to see you.
I really shouldn't have any more.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
Are you all right?
You look a little shaken.
Do you want some mustard with this?
Some cream?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
It smelled of the fire.
What it was, probably...
It's so damn quiet out there.
Melanie, Melanie...
That was Al on the phone.
I got here as fast as I could.
I think it's safe to get out now.
The town looks clear.
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Do you want to try your father again? 
Where are they heading?
When will they stop?
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
The power.
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Can we turn back?
There we are!
That... that... who was that?
Have you got a pencil?
I just came from the school, madam.
The gulls were after your fish, Mr.
I don't know why.
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
How do you plan to do that?
Scotch, light on the water.
Birds?
Then fight back.
Kill them all.
That's right, sir, I recall it.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
I'm going out that way, lady.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year.
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
I'm Donald Fettes.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
I fear he may have to.
There, Master Fettes.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
I didn't mean it that way.
You have his promise, then?
-- pain -- and shock.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
You must leave this house.
He's not home.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
Dr. MacFarlane --
But this woman -- and her son --
Well --
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.
I don't know that -- neither do you.
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
She's unconscious.
I just saw Gray.
You can't -- can't!
What's that you say?
See that, Fettes?
Where shall we put it? In the back?
This is not a woman!
Are you a doctor, too?
Hear him?
Of course -- I don't have friends.
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
I thought this was a school day.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
Come, Toddy -- come.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
You're a teacher, eh?
You?
It might be an interesting case.
Toddy hates me.
Oh, it's you, Gray.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
I am a doctor - a good doctor.
Why should I be afraid of you?
What are you going here?
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
But why, Gray? Why?
I presume you shall.
Can anyone hear what we say?
You and I should work together.
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.
But where did they get those people?
I don't understand the song.
Was the paralysis immediate?
Child seems to take to the lad.
But can anything be done for her?
I'm sorry, Doctor.
And why not?
You're daft.
Crony indeed!
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
You're not going to Gray.
You've been with Gray again.
I hate that picture.
It was one thing her dad rejected you.
Was that it? Well, ok.
Check and mate.
Two down. Two to go.
You think I'm crazy.
Lauren's father's involved.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich.
Where is it? This place?
That was a fucking hollow point!
Think maybe knives do?
Fuck! What do you want?
You killed her. I saw it.
Sssshhh. She's resting.
You lied at my trial.
Hey.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy.
Wrong. Answer.
What did they give you?
You're him!
Fucking Zombie.
I heard you were looking for this.
Fuck. Me.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
The scar. Which of you has it?
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I was a friend of your sister's.
Yeah, no kidding.
Daisy. How did you know?
I know who you are.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
This is where it happened. Right over here.
Are you ok?
Erin. It's not your fault.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
... took everything I ever cared about.
It's ok, it's ok...
... it connects you to me...
In the woods you said you had nothing.
I thought we had an understanding.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
They botched the execution.
Fucking crow.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Just don't believe everything you see.
Maybe we had a case of that here.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan?
An accident, Nathan.
I watched her grow up.
Anything wrong?
What's with your friend there?
You want me to walk a straight line?
Why are there so many?
I want to take this to Lauren.
Erin!
What were you yelling about?
What is it?
What? What is it?
I think I dropped an earring.
You're in with them.
They killed her because she found out.
Sweetheart...
I would never hurt you or Lauren.
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt!
You wrote this?
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
It is not enough to have men of science.
Such power exists?
Bet he is, Mom.
Can I help you look for the space man?
Hi Mom!
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Come on, Bobby.
We sure had fun today.
Go to bed, darling.
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Bobby--!
Now think back hard.
He gave these to you?
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Are you an FBI man?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess.
Boy, I'll bet he's strong.
Maybe four thousand miles an hour.
You think they'll ever find him?
Bobby -- I have an idea.
What does that mean?
Did all these people die in wars?
Go to the movies.
I've got some money.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
We certainly did.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
The skeletal structure is completely normal.
I will make that recommendation to the President.
Good afternoon.
I tried to make you understand.
We're all set.
It was a wonderful day.
Hello--
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
He's not there.
I wonder if we ought to--
Tom, you mustn't -- !
I don't know how to thank you.
Everyone seems so-- 
Excuse me.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
Oh -- hello--
What is it you want?
What happened?
Just twelve.
Why not?
You hold great hope for this meeting.
It must be twelve-thirty.
Where are you going now?
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
Hello.
How dare you write on that blackboard!
Is it worth anything?
You sure about that?
Oh, I see.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
Just passing through Santa Carla?
I don't like horror comics.
How do you like Santa Carla?
I don't like horror comics.
All day.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
Why not?
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
They're gaining on us!
Well... we blew Plan A.
All together?
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
Should I run him through?
Shut up!
They're looking at us.
Good.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Death to all vampires!
We still going?
I can't beat a Triumph.
We were gonna grab some food.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
Don't!  Stop!
I'm my own man.
What's going' on?
Where is she?!
What is this, David?
Where you going?
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
Leave him alone.
Look.
You can't kill me, Star.
Or a vampire.
This is just our cover.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
I have something to tell you guys.
He's not glowing.
He's telling the truth!
What's that smell!?
I thought they'd be in coffins.
Oh, no...
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
We don't have one yet.
Of course not!
David.
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Ouch, my hair...
Dad!
Smells good.  When do we eat?
... And stay outta here.
Thanks, Grandpa...
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Are we havin' fun or what?
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
You didn't tell David?
You like Michael.
Still mad at me?
He looks dead.
It's early.
See you later.
Michael, are you still in bed?
Okay?
Sure.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael.
We're getting close...
Tell them to get something to eat.
Help me, Mom.  Help.
He met a girl.
Lights out, Sam.
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Sam!
Where's Michael?
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
These are my dinner guests.
Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
Oh, no.  Now what?
What did you say?
Ohmygod...
You've got a generous nature.
Say hello to Thorn.
You're cute, Max.
Not impressed, are you?
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Max!  What's wrong?
I'm really sorry, Max.
Something the matter?
Max... what are you talking about?
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Does it burn?
I am?
But you passed the test!
Are you following me?
Well... yeah.  Sure.
Hi...
What's your name?
I guess you're new around here.
Are you hungry?
Ouch.
I have to talk to you.
I have to talk to you.
You've got to put this on.
It's gone.  I feel it!
What!
This is kind of a cool place.
Grandpa does not own a T.
This room is mine.
You're beautiful.
Where are we going?
Do I have to do this?
Go away.
Did you spill something?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Mom's home?...
I'm making you a sandwich.
Lose the earring, Michael.
Michael?
What happened, Michael!?
What did you to do him, Michael?
What??
We've got to stick together, Sam.
It's that girl from the boardwalk.
Star.
Who are you calling?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
What's the matter?
Sixteen.
What do you want from us?
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Maybe dinner.
Where these tracks headed?
That night?
How long were you with the dog?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
Don't you understand?
What you doin'?
Now why'd you go and...
Too damn dangerous.
... Can't you see...?
How you doin', old boy?
Happens all the time, man.
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
What?
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Somebody broke in.
Childs!!
We got to burn 'em.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Let's open it.
Let's open it.  Now...
You catch anything he was saying?
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Lighten your load, sucker.
Childs!  That a fuse?
Cut that out, Copper.
Somebody's taken it.
What's happening?
Torch it over there!
MacReady!
Where's the other half?
What we going to do?!
Torch them!!
What do we do about those three?
MacReady!
What are you doing?
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.
You ain't tying me up.
We should have jumped his ass.
Load of bullshit.
Spaceship of some kind.
I think so.
Not the only one.
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
Screw regulations!
My God, what in hell happened here?
Hey, Sweden!!!
Anything?
What are you doing?
Well, who's got access to it?
Would that test have worked?
Now hold him.
And if anyone tries to wake me...
I guess you're okay.
Goes on like that quite awhile.
Hold on, damn it.
How long will it take you to prepare this?
Can there be... some kind of test?
I'm getting worried about you.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
How many in their party?
Right.  Why not?
Hey, man...!
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Put that down!
We're on fire!
Let's rush him.
Pure nonsense.
Looks good.
How long's it been?
Four!
What's...
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
How's that Thing get to the dogs?
No it ain't there.
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Somebody definitely messed with it.
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
What kind of test?
Tie up Clark, too.
Where were the flashlights?
We've got to find Fuchs.
What if it doesn't come?
He might just wait us out.
This storm do that?
... Hey, somebody!
What is it?
Where was he trying to go?
What about Childs?
Get back!!
Maybe it ain't coming.
You jerking off or just pissed?
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
We should sleep in shifts.
What's happened?!
You hear that?
It's got into the pub!
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
Now how did you get hurt?
What do you do on the towers?
Ah... no.
... Thousands and thousands of people.
She didn't want me to be a climber.
No one ever comes here.
I had a friend who came here once.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
Yes.  Just about here.
Right up your alley, I would think.
Sir... have you a name?
Please, we need your help.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.
We need your help.
Because you'll never die.
When was his mother taken?
My God... I saw this.
So, do we go on?
It's what they want you to see.
In for a penny, in for a pound.
Machines?
Vox?
What's it all for?
This has to end.
Vox --
What's your name?
And what of the Eloi?
What?
Say I just come back again?
Why?
She won't remember you.
Now will you go?
That was a foolish thing to do.
I'm tired of running.
But you've earned a reward for your valor.
It's spectacular...
May I help you?
You're late.
You promised me flowers.
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.
Oh dammit, I love you!
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
I know it's not a diamond but --
You're late.
Alex, what is it?
Let's walk through the park...
Alex, what is it?
Alex...?!
My God...
Heavens, look at that now!
Alex... people are staring.
Let them.
In the future, we'll be better.
Alex, really.
I've been working.
It's my Jamie's birthday today.
What happened to Emma will never go away.
David.
You won't say that in a week.
All right.
Good night, David.
And this would be my study.
This... was my home.
Couldn't help but overhearing.
Did you hear me, lad?
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
How long did you travel?
Yes.
Is there a lot of illness?
His curiosity is amazing.
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.
We don't have anything like this.
Oh, that explains everything.
Why?
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?
Is he all right?
I'm going to sit with Kalen.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Good night, then.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.
This is magnificent...
The mud carriers.
... It was a great city.
Alexander...?
This is where my journey started... right here.
You've welcomed me into your home.
Good -- it looks fine.
Alexander, take my son away.
Kalen...
Mara -- what -- ?!
It was different then.
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Now that's more like it.
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
Dr.
Well, just as I thought.
And roosters.
Yes, sir.
And hungry, I'd say.
"Eloi"?
Oh, very different.
I am the oldest.
Good morning, Alexander.
Where do they take them?!
This is out life, Alexander.
You won't even try?
My fowl have polluted the yard.
Sir, if I may --
If I might explain, sir --
How did you get hurt?
What did you do at night?
We'll see about that.
I want to see your home.
Hello, Mrs.
Sir?
I think I might be.
You ok?
Don't get all worked up, Justin.
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison.
He's recovering on the third floor.
I don't know better.
Relax.
I didn't dream it.
We are not birds of a feather.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
Hello, William.
And what's that?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
Who are you?
You died, Starks.
I don't know how you died.
Of people like you.
How did you come to know their names?
Do I know you from somewhere?
That's right!
Did you know my father?
My father used to talk about you.
We're late.
What should they be looking for?
Where?
You look like you've lost some weight.
You done with your small talk?
This is really happening, isn't it?
I need to get this letter to someone.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
I'm sorry?
Jackie, go play in the snow.
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
Your mom take anything before this happened?
But I like it I guess.
You're just gonna walk?
What're those?
I think I can remember what's on them.
What'd you do?
Jackie, I'm William Starks.
Stop it!
I looked it up.
I gave you my dog tags.
The Jacket.
But no one knew until after...
[Beat] You bled to death.
Do you really believe me?
[Softly] I want to trust you.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
I don't believe a thing she just said.
How long do we have?
What about Captain Medley?
Of course it makes me mad.
Me, too.
You're sure?
They're not here.
What? What are you thinking?
I don't know.
Of course he will.
They've got lives to be grateful for.
That's all you got from him?
Where are we going?
What's happening to me?
What?
You gotta stop thinking like that.
I've been ok.
I think so.
It's ok.
How you doin'?
And if I didn't want to come?
You were convicted of the crime.
Why, what would you do?
You should be careful.
My God you look exactly like him.
What case?
How'd he get it?
So maybe Dr.
Exactly.
What do you mean?
You don't understand.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
Ok fine.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
Why don't you help me?
How do you know about Eugene?
I know.
Who...who kills me?
You're going to be ok, William.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
You know how to get there?
That's Kingsley.
I tried to kill my wife.
What were you talking about the other day?
Oh no, you're pretty young.
It's gonna be sticky.
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now.
You ever been to jail?
It's worse than war.
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Can you drive?
All right.
I'm not sure.
Well, where are you from?
Well, how'd you get here?
No.
Great.
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
What's this?
You want a drink?
This is pretty good. Considering...
So you're a waitress, right?
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
Well, good for you.
You don't think that's crazy?
This is a great song.
But hey, who can forget those words?
I'm sorry.
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!
Hon.
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
Darryl.
Honey?
Who's the nut?
Alright!  She did good!  Didn't she?
How do you know I took it?
I've been better.
We're both fine.
Hey.
No!
This is serious, son.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
Armed robber.
What kind of gun was it?
Good God.
It's just not working like this.
Hey!
Your name's Harlan?
Oh shit.
Don't.
You're beautiful.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
So how come you don't have any kids?
Did you get married real young?
This is J.
Louise, is that you?
Well, I guess I'd better...
Oh.  I... where's Louise?
I am the great and powerful Oz...
What?
Jimmy!
Louise!
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
Where'd y'all go?
Do you love me?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Tell me now.
Is that how you answer the phone?
Hey, peaches.
Hello...
Okay, peaches, okay.
Stop it!
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Will you at least see how it fits?
So whaddya think.
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Don't worry darlin'.
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
Is this your car?
Well, wait now.
We don't need the lantern.
Whose place is this again?
How much longer is it gonna be?
Thelma!
Alright.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Exactly.
Oh my God.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
Louise.  Where are we going?
Shouldn't we go to the cops?
We gotta be inconspicuous.
We have to think this through.
I'm cash poor.
Oh, I don't know.
What do you mean?
You could help me try and figure it out!
Did you finish thinking?
Call him?
I wish we could've brought him with us.
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Yup.
I don't care what you say about him.
So what are you gonna tell him?
I didn't ask him to come!
How do I look?
What happened to your hair?
What's wrong with you?
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Drive!  Drive away!
I'm sorry.
Holy shit.
You're disturbed.
So what's the plan, Thelma?
Ugh!
Thelma.
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?
Fill her up.
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma!
Louise?  Where are we?
Now what?
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
This is so beautiful.
Look!
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
What?
What?!
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I don't want to talk about it!
I'm warning you, Thelma.
What do we do?
I told you to slow down.
I am really sorry about this.
Sorry!
Ready?
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
I think I've really fucked up.
Louise?
Thelma, that is not an option.
He said they're charging us with murder.
You awake?
We should head a little further in.
Oh my God!
I mean really!
Hey.
You know what's happened, don't you?
How far are we from Mexico?
Shit!
Shit!
You're a good friend.
Louise!
What in the hell is it?!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
God!  It looks like the Army!
Now what?
You're a good friend.
We been seein' you all along the way.
What?  What are you talkin' about?
You women are crazy!
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Are you going to apologize or not?
Hi!
Where you goin'?
Oh, Jesus!
No harm, no foul?
Did you get my letter, Mare?
Look at me, Mary.
I'm asking you to leave.
Stop it!
Gay? He said you were gay?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
You're leaving it out.
What's the point?
Give me a break.
It must be great with a wife like that.
Mary again.
I don't know about this, Dom.
That's it, I'm making an oath.
What's so funny?
Wait a second, I never told you that.
Maybe you're right.
Mary's a babe!
No You mean...?
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Shoot.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Well? What are you waiting for?
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous.
Okay, sounds like you're all set.
Why's that?
Wrong.
Dom? What are you?
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
So... I see you made the news.
Bob, do you remember Mary?
A convention?
Who?
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
This is a good one, Mare.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
We're in love with your roommate.
Healy you dog!
Here's the info you asked for.
Very nice.
Okay?
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Nineteen months I been sober.
Here, just have one of these then.
I'm worried about you, man.
Jesus, you know what?
Hello...?
Uh, I'm fine.
So where the hell are you, Healy?
Oh yeah.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
Oh cripes.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
Don't you want to know my name?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
I'm kidding.
Sorry, Pat, out of beer.
Fine. Fine.
The museum?
I know he's around here someplace.
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
Ah, I'd sell that.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Yeah.
So...
Mary ah, forget it.
Fuck!!
Turn it up, Magda.
All set.
How's my stomach taste, she says.
Urrggghh...
Are you okay?
No!
I think your life's about to change.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
What are you doing?
Miami?
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Hey, hey, hey!
You fucked me, man?
Oh Christ... poor dog.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Really?
You know, I really should take your card.
That stalker Ted got to you, right?
You what?
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
How many is that?
Ho-ly shit.
You little fuck.
I swear!
Oh... Sully.
Thanks for picking me up.
I see where you're going.
I can live with those reflections.
Yeah, Steve.
I don't know, it was complicated.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Have you been up all night again?
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
So who's the lucky guy?
What's he like?
Sure.
Bundt cake?
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Don't bet on it.
An old flame?
Holy shit...
Magda!
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Pat's an architect, too.
Pat does projects all over the world.
What's up, Doc?
You don't think they're too big?
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I thought so.
Can I pour you one?
What's up?
I think you'd better sit down.
What...?
I can't believe this is happening.
Uh, well.
Name's Norm.
Oh yeah. Fine.
Hey, you're limping.
Oh he can hold you.
So who you taking to the prom?
Hi, Ted.
I'm sorry.
Ted, are you okay?
Ted, I'm so sorry.
You asshole, what are you --  Mary!
Oh my God.
I can't believe he remembered you.
By the way, how's he doing?
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Well you look great.
I'm kidding.
Hey.
What's that?
Sure.
Now by killer, you mean...?
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
You know what I'd like to see?
Well... why don't you move back?
So you're a writer?
...and then it was all over.
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Get out.
Please leave.
What what are you doing here?
Ted...?
But but what about Steve?
Get over here.
Yeah? What do you want?
What seems to be the situation here?
I, uh... I got it stuck.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Is it the frank or the beans?
One guess.
You're looking at him.
Charlie, that's mean.
Teddy, hon, are you okay?
No, no, please!
Ho there.
Now I've seen it all.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
No! I was pissing!
Hey.
Okay.
Piggyback ride.
We're here, Warren.
Franks and beans!
How are you doing, Warren?
See you, Warren.
See you, Warren.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed.
Starshells.
Good.
Jesus Christ, guys.
He's right, Jack.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
Well, I'm not.
Goddamn Stevenson.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
How does a guy get a rep like that?
Who gives a shit about the midterms now?
The other thing is...
I'll do it.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
Jesus...
Adlai's too weak!
Oh, still sore about this.
My father --
Adlai can handle Zorin.
Where've you been?
And?
We gave so much to get here.
Slow down. Smell that?
Yeah?
Hey, Mac.
What's it about?
You gotta stop 'em.
Jack and Bobby are good men.
The sun came up today.
And the second condition?
John. How much time?
Max.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
How long until the army is ready?
-- I have the authority.
Then we have no choice.
When are you going to be home?
I saw you out there.
How's my favorite President?
It's Tuesday.
Kenny!
Secretary of Defense...
Hey, sport. You winning?
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
Get back out there, kid.
I was eating that.
So what've we got today?
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Should be here any minute.
No choice.
Okay.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly.
We have to try the blockades.
I don't like what's happening.
That's going to be tough.
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships.
What's that?
I don't want to listen to this again.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him.
Hello?
We give them something.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
You must think I'm blind and stupid.
It's transparent.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Bob?
Hey.
Yeah.
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
Mr. Clear Moon.
They're going to kill me next.
What are you doing?
What's this about?
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
Nice piece.
I know where I am.
We got the wire ya was comin'.
Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
What the hell you doing?!
I didn't know him, Sir.
Were you in Nam?
Hey, hey, hey.
Six rounds. 357.
This is a restricted area.
I did.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch.
Keeping of the souls.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Water.
Couldn't sleep.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
Meet me at base. Over.
Who is he?
White eagle feather through the circle.
What'd she say?
She took something from the house.
That's good goddamn work, Ray.
Her oil pan is shot.
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
Alright. Alright...
I'll sleep around a little.
Bastards...
Tread matches. It's the car.
Jesus, you alright?
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi.
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
Ray...
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
What are you --
What?!
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
Big sonuvabuck.
You're an easy man to track, Ray.
He sent me to find ya.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
Why does he wanna see me?
What did he say?
What's he smoke in that?
What did he say?
What was he saying?
The old man saw an owl.
So what?
The owl told him about Leo.
Don't be mad.
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray.
So did this one.
Was-te.
That's not solid.
The old man?
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Walter.
Take care of yourself, Walter.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Still after Jimmy?
Next time I'll be ready.
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
Where was this?
You had a vision.
Bullshit.
What's that?
Jesus. Oil?
This Clear Moon's house?
Alright.
Ray.
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother.
He's gone.
They got us sealed.
That's it.
What about the water...
You take care.
You're the Indian FBI.
This Jimmy's?
Look.
Thank you.
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood.
You burned an American flag today.
Your relatives must've taught you something.
What?
X21, give me a 20.
X22. Read.
No plates.
Ray. X22.
X21. Come back.
What are you doing on the reservation?
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
Ray...
I'm not that sure.
What ya want?
You ever try solitary confinement?
Not for long, Richard.
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
No way. No fuckin' way.
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth.
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
I'll bet!
Now I know why all the girls come here.
It isn't?
Yeah, most likely.
Can I walk you out?
I thought he'd never leave.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
I beg your pardon.
It's what?
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance.
Two.
The what?
It never came up.
I can't.
And probably never again.
Let's make it at eight.
Why'd you do that?
It dies. We live.
No!
Does it bother you?
You know what really scares me?
You're totally insane.
Come on.
I want it understood.
Food...and you...my F-14!
Danger?
Lucky charm.
...they say you're alright.
Where are we?
No.
You look way out there.
You don't believe that.
What do you do when you come here?
How do you play reality.
Want to play the game?
Goose is dead.
What does it mean?
You didn't mean it.
One more.
Looks like a tie.
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
Well?
Well... What   is   it?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
Yes, Sergeant?
Can't shake him.
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
MAVERICK.
I've got a six strobe.
That's missile lock!
We're locked on MiG ONE.
I'm pulling up.
OKAY.
WHAT?
What are you doing?
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo.
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
Ohhh Mother!
Don't WORRY!
Now have you got it?
I've got it -- hold on!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
No! Not again!
Gotta go, man.
Is there something I should know?
You're not supposed to...
You hear that?
Let me do the talking.
Why do you all have such funny names?
Well, I don't know. That depends.
It's not Cougar's place.
That's not what I heard.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun?
So I've heard.
You think you can stay up with us.
What was that?
How was it?
Nice.
Look at the weather!
What are you doing?
Keller, Black Lion Squadron.
You ever done this before?
Hey Mav, this is Sally.
I've lost him -- where is he?
Great move. Great
We did it!
It's a victory roll.
Hi.
Come on, we're next.
Come on, come on!
What the hell is this?
Something bothering you?
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
Just cover Wood, Maverick.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
Relationships are a bitch, here.
I'm pinned to the panel.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
1000.
That's Kazanski.
Man, you guys gooned it.
I was a victim of circumstance.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
He's the best you have.
Mav's a great flyer but....
A plaque?
No, we...got our butts kicked.
It's kind of ironic.
Coogan spent half the night looking for her.
Hear about Ice?
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE.
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
ON THE NOSE?
I guess I owe you one.
Figured it out yet?
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
He just won't engage.
Who's the hell is that?
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
You won?!!!
It was bad.
You didn't help.
Morning, Coogan.
He's a good pilot.
Was going.  Now you are.
You just did an incredibly brave thing!
Yes sir..
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
I had him in view.
Why?
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
I can take care of myself.
How do you feel?
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
It's no disgrace, kid.
How can I go on?
What's wrong with this one?
Where's yours?
Welcome to Mars.
What to the rebels want?
So, where to?
First time on Mars?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.
Lemme ask you a question.
What happened to number five?
Need a ride?
Shut up and drive!
How could you do this?
What do you want?
Don't bother looking.
Hmm.
I'll go encode your room key.
There you go, Mr.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
Come on, Cohaagen!
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
I didn't want it to end this way.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
He had help.  From our side, sir.
Now let's get down to business.
Stop fighting and get out.
Kill him.
Bob?
I'm with an very important client.
What the fuck is going on here?
Listen to me!
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
Two-headed monsters?
So, been married long?
Your sexual orientation?
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
What do you want?
Amazing.  Where are we?
You open it.
Suppose I do...then what?
What is it?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
HER!
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
Pull them out.
Hey, hey Tony.
Sit down.
Shit!
They found us!  Everybody out!
Hey Harry...Harry!
I don't know.  Maybe.
Why not?
Hey, Quaid!
What trip?
Harry, what the hell is this?
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid.
Where?
I want that fucker dead.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
Where is he?
Shit!
I've got a weak signal over there.
He's not at ground level.
I've got a lock!  There!
Look at this shit.
I'm sorry.
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Would you please repeat the destination?
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Is that better?
Who?
Who is she?
It's not funny, Doug.
Let me go!
...You mean it?
Lori...
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Well...What do you say?
You are somebody.
What are you doing?
Muggers?
Harry from work...He was the boss.
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
O.
Clever girl.
I suppose you're not here either.
I love you.
Doug...Bob McClane.
Now help me out here, Doug.
All right.
I give up.
Secret agent...How much is that?
Go on.
They'll be here any minute!
I love you.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
...What?
I don't remember you.
What, did you get amnesia?
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
She wasn't really my wife.
I think you better leave.
I said get out!
I thought you didn't like me.
So you dropped by to apologize?
Now what?
Not bad, for a hooker.
The first settlers are buried here.
What can I do?
He's lying.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
Where are you going?!
Where's this "reactor" come from?
You sure about this?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.
The whole core of Mars is ice.
What's wrong?
This is the suitcase you gave me.
Wait!
Rhonda.
Or a big mother slug maybe?
You guys all set?
You stupid punk!
Okay, Burt, listen.
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Yeah, still got one poking around.
What?
How much you think?
What the hell is that, anyway?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us.
I can't believe it.
Knock it off, Burt!
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
A beauty, isn't it?
What the hell you doing back already?
Burt!
Let's go you two.
That's fine.
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.
She's got my vote.
BACK OFF, BURT...!
Well, we'll ask around.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.
I might have an idea...
You know, up the jeep trail.
Well, we can take my truck then.
Oh my God.
He'll never make it!
We're not going over there, right?
So...now what?
Where the hell are they?
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
You didn't cook breakfast?
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Who the hell's that?
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Catch it later, Pham.
So what if we just did it.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.
She's got us.
We did it!
So long, cactus!
Jeez, look at that guy.
You're full of shit.
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Oh, Jesus!!
Jesus!
Fuck you!
It must've grabbed us.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
Car's gone.
Shut up!
What the hell are they?
This is one big mother!
We'll take your word for it.
Prairie dog burrow...
I don't know.
Well.
Son of a bitch!
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Don't he have a home to go to?
Run for it?
You go north, I'll go south.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
Wait a minute.
But...we could pull something!
Watch your ass, shithead.
Damn it.
Come on, everybody!
Well.
Use the fucking bomb!
What the hell are you doing?!!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
Road's in!
Somebody paying you to do this?
Fine, make the mistakes I did.
How's she doing?
We playing cards tonight?
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
Down, honey, down.
Burt!  Heather!
We're here, Val.
I'm dead.
Well, what's wrong with it?
You sure this is where it was?
Come on.  Get away from it!
Hey Val, listen.
And I appreciate it.
I don't believe this.
Twenty.
I've got a plan.
Hi, I'm Rhonda.
Listen, got a question for you.
Darn it!
Think it's still following us?
Ready?
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
What's it doing?
Yeah, they're confused.
What?
Look, the situation hasn't changed.
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?
I think the ground's getting closer.
It worked!  There they go!
I brought it... to the coroner.
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
...we had to lick his boots clean.
Demerol?
...Where're we goin'?
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
Ms. Vin's sister.
Gimme back my bottle.
Don't hurt him.
Objection, your Honor!
I will allow the witness to testify.
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Objection.
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken.
Good morning, Mr.
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
Look, I'm a lawyer and --
What, "everything"?
Clyde, you wait here.
No it's not the only issue.
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.
Come now. Did you see the gun?
Not the whole time, of course. I --
You're implying that I planted a gun?
You see that?
We have a full caseload, Rog.
Ten years is a long time.
Where?
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary.
...So what would we claim?
-- Easy as that, huh?
When did you start working for the goddam D.
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
That DD-5.
Do you have to do that?
His name is Chuckie Roeder.
Uh, Eddie?
A fucking wheelchair?
Eddie Dowd.
So what're we gonna do?
But Roeder's dead.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
-- What?
They could've been brothers.
...Jesus!
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
They're Chinamen who speak English.
Murder witness.
Lemme guess.
I embellished.
A fucking wheelchair?
-- Find him?
The Joe Boys in 1980...!
Got any booze in the house?
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
My mother find you?
But why would a guy would do that?
No.
...I'm dying out there.
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
-- How could I help you?
'lo, Cecil.
Oh come on, Cecil.
I did two tours in 'Nam...
I'd l-like to answer the question.
Edward T. Dowd.
I see: He'd walk out next month.
I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up.
You don't speak any Chinese dialects?
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
I don't think I know that name.
No.
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes.
You getting this?
It's okay. It was always like that.
What do you want?
I followed you here from court.
Look. Mister --
Five years.
You're a l-lawyer?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
CIA?
No... No, go away.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
That's not important.
No.
Where were you for the last hour?
I'M NOT KIDDIN'.
I'm nearly out.
Here he comes.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
We can do it right here.
Bobby's got it.
A basic kill.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
What the hell is that thing doing out there?
GOD.
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
You weren't kiddin'.
Is there a golf course around here?
Thanks for your help, Carl.
Okay, that's it.
Did you know Teresa Banks?
You try that you little monkey.
Yes...
Congratulations. I heard about that.
GOOD LUCK, CHET.
What is it, Gordon?
Phillip?
HE'S GONE.
QUICKLY MEN.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
And no one found the ring?
Where is the ring?
Had the FBI here once before.
Take a good look around.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond.
He's with me.
That was really something.
Sort of shorthand.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
Crushed skull.
Accidental?
What is it?
Agent Desmond, it's...
She lived alone.
You better dust this place, Sam.
Take a look at this.
One thing that has been troubling me.
James called me last night looking for you.
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Are you going to see James tonight?
Yes, James is very sweet.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Laura?
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
Do you want to talk?
I'm in a mess today, too.
Goodbye, Muffin.
Where are you going?
Where are the Cookies?
What are you doing?
No.
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
I can't remember anything about last night.
Hey, Pete.
Nice night.
You missed somethin', Ed.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
The diary was hidden too well.
You're not Bob are you, Harold?
I hate him, I hate it.
What about James?
Baby, you know why?
That's right.
Right on time, baby.
James...
Laura, do you love me?
Where were you last night?
I've got to see you.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You always hurt the ones you love.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
History is on our side, Ben.
Josie, I think we should go public.
Can I take the car?
Laura.
You lied to me about those school books.
I hate asparagus.
Where's Dad?
Good night, Mom.
Dad.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Let me see.
Who was that?
Dad... Dad... Who was that?
Are you sure you're okay?
Dad?
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
Hello, Laura.
Neither is mine.
Leland, what are you doing?
Leland...
Did you get this from your lover?
When's the next business trip, big fella?
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
Laura just took off.
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Abraham...
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
He was accused of jury tampering.
What are you doing here?
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...he wants to testify...?
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
They lied.
I did.
Ed Concannon.
Objection, we've...
Objection!
Mr. Concannon...?
Objection!
No further questions.
Thank you, your Honor.
No, actually, she was referred to me.
Anything special about the case?
Thank you. When Debby...
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
Please sit down.
What is this going to cost?
You said you're gonna call me up.
It's all right, Mickey.
Dr. Thompson...?
Dr.
I didn't do too well for you.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
She getting good care over there?
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.
Dr. Gruber...
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
I read the hospital report on your client.
Yes.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
Thank you...
Hi.
Thank you.
Kathy Price...
Yes.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yessir. I'm sorry.
That's it...?
What is it?
I need an extension for my case.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Sustained.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Nothing further, your Honor...
I object, your Honor...
D'you find an apartment?
Jimmy!
Would you like me to leave...?
I've got to work...
Why don't you get some rest?
Do you think it's my fault?
And it's over...?
Joe...  Joe...
You're pressuring yourself...
Is it over?
Thank you.
Continental Casualty...
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
I can subpoena you, you know.
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy?
It's not a good case.
He saw her at the Northern Care...
We just can't do it anymore.
What does it mean?
Dr. Gruber.
I.
Another, Frank...?
I want to buy you a drink.
Well, well, well. Huh?
Hi, Mickey...
I have to talk to you.
Are you out of your mind...?
Mick. Mick. Mick...
...he's a good man...
Who have we got?
Jimmy?
Been a long time, huh...?
So what?
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
What happened, Joey...?
Yeah? How's our new witness?
How are you holding up?
Okay.
Are you with me... are you awake...?
Uh... the admitting nurse...
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
...yeah... good...
...four years ago...
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing in New York...?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.
We got a mistrial, you know.
Dr. Towler...
Franky can't make it.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
It's an enemy sneak attack.
Hey, there - open up!
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
Hurry up!  Jump in!
You look kinda lost yourself.
Is that it over there?
Did you see it come down?
You seem to know a lot about him.
I do know him...slightly.
They've all stopped at the same time.
How does it happen cars are running?
The troops are certainly moving in here!
Good to see you, General.
You'll hit something!
Is that... machine...?
I almost forget when I ate last.
I've been as close to them as anyone.
How long was I out?
Nothing there now.
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
They've blocked it!
The Rockies...!
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
That needle ain't pointing north!
What is that gizmo?!
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
Gratzman!
I got a message for you.
It's about that meteor.
Colonel - shooting's no good!
That's their position?
We will, sir!
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!
Uncle Matthew.
They don't do much of anything...!
They are living creatures out there.
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
Number three to.
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit.
Must be somebody in there.
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
What'll we say to 'em?
They'll understand us, all right!
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
I don't know, Bob.
Might as well be, Dylan.
Just an earthquake, Dylan.
One of mom's cups got broken.
Dylan, it's breakfast.
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
Maybe.
What if it isn't over?
It was nothing.
Heather?
What's up?
He's had some sort of...episode.
Chase.
Yes.
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
Does he have to stay here over night?
Like what?
Ms.
Doctor...
Ms.
DO you mind...
I want my kid out of here now!
No way he's going anywhere.
no.
You going away?
Someone's coming.
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
Rex saved me.
Time for sleep.
Tomorrow night.
Who?
He's on his way.
Mommy's fine, Dylan.
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
In my bed.
And...what's the man doing?
Do you have to die to see God?
Why does God let there be bad things?
Home.
You okay, champ?
Tell you what.
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!
Dylan, where's the man?
What...what is that?
Yes.
You okay?
In what, a romantic comedy?
Heather?  You doing okay?
Darker.  More...evil?
What...happened?
You're not crazy, by the way.
I've never mentioned it to him.
Freddy, for all I know.
John Saxon.
Holy...
I know how Chase really died.
Heather Langenkamp?
I want to see the body.
Studio B.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.
Heather, what is it?
I'll call the cops for you.
No, Rex is not going to die.
No, I don't think that at all.
I can tell you what the nightmares are about.
Like the Genie in the bottle.
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Dylan.
I don't know if it has, really.
Of course he is.
Yes?
Can I get you something to drink?
Did we lose anybody?
That low passed through last night.
Looks like weather.
He would have loved this.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
What?
You may not like what you hear.
Why did we begin this?
What are they doing?
Everyone aboard young Bill?
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
Come in.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
Carry on.
Why didn't you drop any sail?
Okay, here's the duty.
There's still a way.
Make us proud.
Where's Mom?
Fine.
Albatross?
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
She isn't that old.
I walked in on my parents one time.
Yeah.
Where you going?
Yeah, that's right.
I cheated to get on the boat!
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
You okay?
Ninety-six.
It's a ninety-one!
I couldn't have done it without you.
Feels different doesn't it?
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.
You know, I never had friends like this.
You gonna jump?
I'm just not like you.
Hey, shut up will ya?
God damn it man.
Why'd you do it?
Can we talk?
Sorry to here it.
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
Do you have your ticket?
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
What the hell is going on?
Jesus.
How ya doing?
I feel like I got you into this.
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
No way!
So... What happened?
What'd you do?
My parents don't do it anymore.
Where are you from any way?
It was so real...
Who told you that?
That's how he died you know.
What are they doing?
I can't go in there.
Hold her steady into the wind.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Northeast sir!
Yes, sir.
You all right?
Uh, huh.
Shouldn't we turn away?
What's on your mind?
Well, spit it out.
Can't do it.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
Stow away?
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
I'm Francis Boutillier.
I'll be frank with you.
We'll do our best.
What is it we can do for you today?
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
Spying?!
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.
Who is it Philip?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
What?!  What's happening?!!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Immortality.
Jesus.  She's got guns.
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.
Me, too.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
What's your problem?
Don't ever call me stupid.
I'll read it.
How would you know?
They tell you that?
It matters to me.
Why, man?
I don't.
That's not a satisfactory answer.
This isn't just a story!
What?
Well, that was neighborly.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
Tie it off!!
What do you think?
We've got a problem.
You gotta be kidding?
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
How long you been standing there?
What are we supposed to talk about?
Phil.  What are you doing?
It's outta here!
I don't know.
You're a day late.
Suicidal...
Do you have something to say?
No, sir.
I'm not gonna kill it.
Swing up, son.
What's it going to be?
What are you blubbering about?
Don't look down.
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
No.
Yes, that's true.
Yes.
The families.
And you didn't do anything about it?
Easy for you to say.
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
Meetin' him at the gate.
Sorry, gentlemen.
What's Cao Ben?
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
I'm from all over.
Need a hand?
How 'bout a beer?
This your car?
Thought you said this was a private club.
No... I don't think so, man.
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
What's she doin' here?
Nice of you to drop by.
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
Gas?
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
Hey!
So who you out sleuthin' for now?
Alright.
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas.
So, it's back to the islands.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
Oh, many things...
That is my permiso.
My name's George Kovich.
The Good Witch...
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
In what capacity?
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
Why are you in New Orleans?
The same to you.
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
Hasta siempre.
I forgot to show you this.
I knew this would happen.
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
I got some news, Marietta.
Who was that?
What is it, Johnnie?
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey.
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
Damn it, child!
Nothin', honey.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
I'm scared, mama.
Hey baby...
You're perfect for me, too.
I said you can be too crude sometimes?
So how'd he finally nail you?
He was short but powerful.
You okay, honey?
What you want to watch this trash for?
What's that honey?
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Sailor?
Actin' funny how?
...are followin' him around.
Let's go dancin', peanut.
Sailor!
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere.
That don't smell like a More.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
How about that one?
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads.
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
Sailor Ripley!
We're about dry bones, sweetheart.
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
Huh?
The water was rollin' off me.
You think he saw us?
Sure you wanna do this?
I wouldn't mind a little night life.
You ready for this?
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'.
What's wrong, sweetheart?
How much we got left, honey?
What's that, peanut?
Lula, you there?
Oh God, Sailor.
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
I can't take this, Sailor.
She died right in front of me.
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
And no AC.
That you, Sail, honey?
You find any work?
Anything I can do for you?
Sailor? You know what?
It's okay by me, peanut.
You been drinkin', huh?
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
Sail?
Who says I'm smart?
That man's a black angel, Sailor.
You must be my son.
You hungry?
I'm sorry, Sailor.
LULA!!!!
...live in exchange for sexual favors.
Mama???
I'm fine, mama.
Lula?
You're comin' home, precious.
I'm goin', mama.
Oh God! What does that mean?
I knew you'd want it again...
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
You got nice tits.
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
Santos... What's happenin' here?
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
I'll tell you the problem.
He's fine. He's narrating.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
I like what you've done with it.
You all right, Professor Tripp?
You snore.
It's the Chancellor.
Thank you.
Tripp!
Emily?
It's fine.
He said something about being between things.
Trip??
Is that just beer?
He has a book.
So. Is he any good?
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
That was good.
What's this guy's problem?
Shit.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Tripp?!
You stay there.
Honestly, Tripp.
How bad is it for you?
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
Jesus.
So modest.
Crabtree.
Is he awake?
Shut up, James.
Who do you think it is?
I want to publish this.
So -- what do we do now?
Want some help with that?
Let me get this straight.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Naturally you have copies.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
Came to my senses.
Me? What can I do?
You peeked, didn't you?
How are you -- is it Joe?
I'll be... somewhere else.
You driving this car?
I passed out.
I know.
Look, Mr.
Vernon.
Not true.
It's just a souvenir.
Who the hell is that?
Let me get this straight.
Hey, Vernon.
Boy or girl?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Hello?
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
...reconcile with Emily.
Goodbye, Grady.
It was my mother's.
It's just.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
Listen, James, about this afternoon.
You cold, James?
Actually, I saw the greenhouse.
James.
Is that really it?
Go ahead.
They're glass. The buttons.
Pretty good.
I'm sorry.
Shit, James.
Do you have a mirror?
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
I don't know.
That's a big trunk.
Oh.
Looks like.
This is so embarrassing!
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Shit.
Thank you.
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
Huh?
Want me to get that?
He didn't give his name.
Afraid so.
Professor Tripp?
How's that?
I got kicked out.
It's not so bad.
Isn't this...?
I can't help myself.
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Don't be proud, James.
Humboldt County?
It's a bit of a scandal.
This is so nice.
The one that left you?
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
Maybe she didn't come here.
Relax.
It feels really... good... here.
I just wanted a little sip.
So, why did you take me up there?
It's warm.
You're lying.
But, last night...
Let me spell it out for you, James.
You coming?
Want a bite?
It's because you don't eat.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
Where you going?
I'm not going with them.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Get out of here.
Professor Tripp...?
Yes, Hannah?
Thanks for that. He all right?
He's going with me.
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter.
So what are you going to do?
Look, Hannah.
His bag.
All right.
I thought we were going to talk.
Hey.
Listen, Hannah.
The aunt, Hannah.
He cribbed that from Borges.
Right.
Professor Tripp.
Easy there.
I need to talk to you.
New?
You go first.
I'm sure.
Emily left me this morning.
So.
Is that Cristaile?
Sara, my arm.
You had another one, didn't you?
Well...
Not have it.
Who's gun is that?
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
Pow.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt.
I believe you.
Who's that sitting in your car?
Sara.
Oh?
Someone stole my car.
He told you.
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
Ouch. How many?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Did you tell Walter?
Did you just make that up?
You don't deserve me, you know.
The more the merrier.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia.
That's a nice greenhouse.
Who's he barking at now?
I need a ride.
Listen, Antonia --
He's writing his name in water.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
That's nice.
Walter?
Who's this ?
No.
No.
Is it good?
Oh, right.
Who's that guy?
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
Yo, Traxler.
Do you get high, Sam?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Yes.
What made you pull out that old thing?
Where's Emily, Hank?
Where you stand?
Hardapple?
One other thing.
Are you riding with me, James?
George Sanders?
There's so many...
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills.
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
You doing okay?
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Hey, is that a school?
Living across the street from a grade school.
One hundred and twenty feet.
I should go.
What are you doing?
Cherry.
Notice the grain.
It's my own design.
What's happening?
Fucking Mariners.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
I've got some good news.
Aren't you glad?
Anna will be away at camp.
I get horny as hell for other women.
It's crazy out there.
Carlos, can I ask you something?
What do you mean?
What are you looking at?
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
They're starlings.
You always carry these?
I'd love to hear it.
Something like that.
See anything interesting?
What are you writing in that book?
Don't you have friends?
What does that mean?
Hiya, Walter.
What's up?
You don't know?
I haven't broken any laws.
Cherry?
It's not for sale.
Okay?
Too much sun.
Your ivy.
You walked home.
You knew her?
You don't know?
I wasn't feeling well.
He I.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
The passionate one?
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
So. How are you adjusting?
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
I'd keep away from him.
Just trying to be helpful.
Have you seen Walter?
People have the right to know.
Yeah, like the bird.
Walter.
What?
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
What's her name?
But will he... ?
Walter?
No.
And how's your job?
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
Try it.
How's the journal?
You don't like coming here, do you?
How do you feel about that?
How long is this going to take?
I don't know.
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
You're very late.
When did it all start?
Close your eyes.
No, I am not going to --
Who do you see?
Where is she?
And what are you doing?
What the hell are you doing there?
Don't ever do that again.
Did you get an erection?
When the two of you held each other.
She's still really hurt.
It's going to take time, Walter.
What?
Want a ride?
There's something wrong with this picture.
Very weird.
You're quiet at work.
You never spoke to me before.
Are you?
Southern light.
You plan to drink both those beers?
Is that a school?
What about bears?
Something happened to you.
I'm not easily shocked.
So?
So, you're not a dyke.
Hey, that was... intense.
What's the problem?
Tell me about it.
Did I say something wrong?
Hey, there.
Why do you want to know?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
So, what did you do?
You're not joking.
Look, you can go now.
Sorry.
I never hurt them. Never.
Why don't you just go now, okay?
What was prison like?
You mean the time you're locked away?
I've changed.
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
You know, this is crazy.
For men like me.
I got poked around... here and there.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
You're scared.
We should live together.
It's a bad idea.
I say we call it quits.
What's this?
I don't need a plant.
Thank you.
Don't be scared, Walter.
Don't do that.
What's going on?
I didn't sleep well.
You okay?
I heard they were filthy birds.
Goddamnit!
This ain't no drill, slick.
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
She-hit.
How you guys doing?
You got it?!  You got it?
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
Nice shot, Lins.
Bud!
What's goin' on, Boss?
Okay so far.
Where are we?
Lord Almighty.
Deep and slow, big guy.
Okay, Jammer.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
I can't believe you let them do this!
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
You need me.
You wanna know what I think?
I think you were worried about me.
No, I think you were.
What are you still wearing that for?
I haven't worn mine in months.
Did you get anything on the cameras.
Hippy, just relax.
What's the scoop, ace?
Need some help?
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
Jesus, Lindsey--
You dumb jarhead motherf--
He's got the shakes?
I think it likes you.
He's jammed the mechanism.
You owe me one, Virgil.
You did okay, back there.
You totaled it, huh?
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
Try again.
Well, that's that.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
You see where it's coming in?
Can't get to it.
Son of a bitch!
Okay.
Alright, put this on.
It is insane.
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
No, Bud, no... not you.
Hello, Brigman.
We'll take reading as we go.
Look, it's three AM.
We'll go in through that large breach.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Did you find Wilhite?
Virgil?
What's the matter with you?
No, I mean it.
That's Perry.
Come on, man.
Lins, stay away from that guy.
Is that it?  Is this right?
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.
He's convulsing!
'Fish'?
Hafta.
Howdy, y'all.
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.
You better not say you missed that.
Y'all could be more specific.
I think they're from 'you know'.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Those guys ain't so tough.
Hippy, you pussy.
Quiet!  Quiet!
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
SHIT!
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Get comfortable.
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Cab One, radiation readings?
Copy that, continuing forward.
Radiation is nominal.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
No.
12000 feet.
Uh, oh...
Fluid breathing system.
Hey!
Stand by on the ROV.
Getting a reading?
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.
4800 feet.  It's official.
8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
He's losing it.
He can still make it.
What kind of light?
Would we see the flash?
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
When do you have to go back?
How are you?
Sandro.
But where are you going?
Did you sleep well?
Which one shall I wear?
Claudia, aren't you coming?
And how long will you be away?
Used to what?
This looks to me like a good sign.
These people are contemptible.
What is that one over there called?
Well?
How wonderful!
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
Somebody must live here!
Really!
Don't be so humble.
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Shall we go for a swim?
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Find anything?
Nothing... nothing at all!
Are you feeling better?
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Have you read it?
Claudia, listen to me...
Any news?
What is it, Claudia?
Good.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Claudia, let's get married?
But why am I so infatuated with you?
But you know it already.
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro ...What's the matter?
No, Sandro... Please...
What are you saying?
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
You're that sleepy, eh?
Good night, my love.
He amuses me.
What amazes me, is Sandro.
But where did you finally end up?
It's divine!
I'm not coming.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
Now, listen.
Who are you talking to?
Please, you come too...
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
What happened?
Looks like the weather is changing.
I'll stay here also.
How did you spend the night?
Let's try to be practical about this.
And what are we going to do now?
And who is this?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Ettore...
Where is she going?
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew.
Giulia...
Don't you ever paint men?
Yes, sir. Three times.
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
We have a radio like this, too.
Certainly a radio this small is very practical.
Music, of course.
Anything new develop?
Are you the owner of this place?
Whose boat is that?
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place.
And here's Sandro.
Did you manage to find good rooms?
Your mother?
Why have we stopped?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Here I am, Patrizia.
Zuria?
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
Because I'm getting fat.
I'm being punished.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
Hello.
You have a lovely voice.
No I'm not.
First thing that comes to your mind?
What's your real name?
Where do you think babies come from?
Do you know a Marie?
You liked Sister Paul?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
What did you do?
Agnes.
You're listening to a chorus of angels.
I'm frightened.
How did you have a baby?
And then what happened?
What is it?
My bed.
Which one?
Who?
Alright Agnes.
Agnes, can you hear me?
She said Michael.
The statue.
Are you frightened?
Stay away from me...
God!
It was dead.
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
What did you do?
I've been watching.
Are you dictating my position to me?
Here you are.
Larry...
Larry...
Thanks. 
Martha, it's you.
???
All I want is one more week.
No, no, no...
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
The convent was built for over fifty.
Oh that one there, in the corner.
No.
You were a smoker?
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
She can't even remember the birth.
Well... what do you think?
That's absurd!
This convent is locked solid.
This was before her pregnancy?
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
You hate us don't you?
It's my affair too.
I'm only interested...
She is not a child.
???  
All right, what do you need.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
There's nothing here.
When was that?
You lied to me
Like keeping her home from school?
And my permission?
We'll see about that.
An unhappy woman...
Because I am a moral person.
It wasn't sex.
My sister died in a convent.
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
Right.
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
May I be present?
I've just met with the bishop.
But how did it happen?
This is permission to take her apart.
Who knew she was pregnant?
That's enough.
Oh, don't do this!
Of course, John.
Lay them down.
They're yours.
Why aren't you at work?
What about all these letters?
Shurrup!
Can you fix him for me?
All right, all right.
Sure.
You don't think...
Leave them drums alone.
Yeah, you know, "O.
Ever seen one of these before?
We're nearly there, sir.
Are you going in?
Me? Why?
I don't snore.
Now, you'll like these.
That's not your Grandfather.
Gerron.
Aye, but don't rush.
Did you look in here?
Sure. .
What's up?
Ringo!
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Oh, there you are!
Well ... come on.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Should I say it?
I don't think that bit's right.
What are we waiting for?
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
No, I didn't you did ...
Hello, he's not talking to me.
Sorry.
Oh!
Are you supposed to be here?
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Ah.
Where are you off to?
What are you doing?
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Hello, Grandfather!
And we're looking after him, are we?
Come on let's get this coffee.
That'll keep you busy.
You see.
Oh no, you're not.
All right, how about Ringo?
Anything to spare?
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
No, that's his other one.
Is that yours?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
Well, what are we waiting for?
What are you doing there?
How d'you reckon that one out?
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Gie's a kiss!
Give 'em a pull.
I hope he fell off.
Let's go and muck in.
Behave...
What's he know?
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Don't move, any of you.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
I'll brook no denial!
Now get on with it.
Let's have you.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
They're nearly ready for you.
John, I'm talking to you.
Hi Norm!
Control yourself or you'll spurt.
Hello.
My eyes are lighter.
You're a window rattler, son.
It'll only get you into trouble.
He's betrayed the class.
That's right.
Well!
Well, look after him.
And?
Eh, where's my grandfather?
I've got the stuff. Come here.
Where's my grandfather?
He belongs to Paul.
None for me, then?
That's mine.
Well ...
Stop picking on him.
What do you think are you're up to?
Look after him.
Yeah, you want to watch it.
He's been gone a long time.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
... as they head up for the show.
How's that?
Course he can talk.
What's the matter with you?
Eh.
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
Eh, what's all this?
What is he?
Oh... God... am I cold...
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
Locked.
Engines off.
Good!
Are you in pain?
Where's Irth?
I don't recognize that constellation.
I got it.  Oh boy.
Can you get it a little closer?
Any rotation?
Dell, I want greater magnification.
Activate lifter quads.
Approaching point of origin.
Close enough to walk to!
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
I'll go first.
Just machinery.
This is Chaz.
What is it?
Maybe we can get in by the top.
Can we come up?
Are you okay in there?
How do you feel, Dell?
What's wrong?
Breathe deeply.
Computer, this is Captain Standard.
I have recorded the transmission.
Computer, what language was that?
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
Unknown!  What do you mean?
Yes!
Computer!
How long to fix?
Hello, Faust!
<u>He</u> died.
Yes?  What is it?
You like this shit?
But we can't kill it.
Where's it coming from?
Okay.
What happened to the lights?
Where does that go?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
What the hell's going on?
Oh -- God -- oh --
Boy do I feel a lot better.
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
Well, uh.
Martin, this is Jay.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
It's really on there tight.
Hey, guess what?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
Oh it's okay.
So does anybody have any suggestions?
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
It's clear.
Hey, are you guys still there?
Where did it come from?
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
It makes me sick to see him like that.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
It's over, Hunter.
Hey now, what is this?
There.  Should be coming through about there.
I'll do it.
Now we're in for it.
No, don't open the door.
Yes?
I think I could cobble something together.
Maybe we don't have to.
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
We've got six hours left.
Oh no!
It will be.
It must have stopped moving.
The flamethrower!
Now what's wrong?
What?  What was that?
I'm getting nowhere.
I've got 'em!
Oh no.
Look at that.
What's happening up here?
This is horrible.
That must have been when he got it.
What common objects?
Don't count on it.
Recognizable!  In that?
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
We can't kill it on board.
Blow the ship up?
This should do it.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
First contact...
I've got it.
Just settle down.
Receiving.
That way.
What's wrong?
It's close, real close.
Air lock?
This looks ancient.
What'd he say?
Here's his line.
There, it caught!
<u>What is it</u>?
Oh God, oh God no.
It won't come -- it's stuck.
It's stopped?
No, thank God... just missed him.
That sounds a little fanciful...
Too primitive.
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
How?
And what do we do when we find it?
I thought I'd find you here.
They're getting pretty close now.
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.
We do know that.
No.
Where are we?
This is Chaz speaking.
Oh my God.
It's out of focus.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
What the hell happened?
Yeah, okay. 
Okay, Chaz, I hear you.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
Martin?
Find anything we missed?
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
This ship is full of cat hair.
Hey, can you guys hear me?
Here, Chaz.
You hear me, Martin?
I understand why you did that.
Would somebody fill me in?
What film?
Where did the parasites come from?
Take us up.
Engaged.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
We won't need it then.
These will be very useful.
Yes!
What's it doing, having a seizure?
Hey, wait a minute!
Now what?
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
Two down, four to go.
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
This is all the same creature.
Which presumably means...
I saw it.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
It was time for that a couple days ago.
Let's hear it.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
So what do we do?
Kill me...
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
Headache?  Dehydration?
Can I... um... have some water?
What is it?
Better?
Me either.
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
It's a rhino.
Yeah, it's fine.
Looks like a spore.
Let's get back and call this in.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
We've got no option.
Minh...
A pair of incomings.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
What do you need?
Seal everything now!
How many of them are there?
Give or take.
Are you alright?
Where is she?
I found it...
I can't reach her.
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Where're they headed?
When?
Picking up velocity.
What's going on?
It's too late!
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
Oh, man...
How much air-time have I got?
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
Listen to what?
De Vries?
Something spooking the rhinos?
Hey, Guttierez?
One of 'em must have escaped.
Whoa, wait a minute...
What?
What the hell are you doing?
Alright, okay.  Look...
But I'm going first...
Careful of that edging there...
Still got him?
Hold it, hold it...
What?  Where?
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
Wait.  Lost it.
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
What happened?
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.
Shit!
That sounds promising.
Is this the suit?
We had to.
And...?
That's what we thought.
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
Already working on it.
They've changed their heading again.
Central Pumping.
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.
They knocked out the external feeds.
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.
It's not all good news.
There's still time to back-out.
Thanks.
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
Okay, we're in business.
Okay, I'm out of here!
See that sheathing on the suspension?
Hey, boss.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.
I'm serious.
What is that?
Seltzer?
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Don't worry about it.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
I've found Ackland!
Think I spoke too soon...
Do you believe him?
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.
So, what do you think?
What?
That's the wrong way!
Hurry it up.
Where'd you leave them?
Jesus.
How's it going?
Hello, there. Who are you?
How do you know my name?
May I come in?
Of course your performance was no surprise to me.
Hungry?
Just like that, eh?
I don't think that's funny.
What a day - what a heavenly day...
It'll be a night to remember.
What time?
The mark of a true killer.
Suites are for expense accounts.
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.
Addison...
So that's it.
Addison, won't it be just perfect?
I see.
What do you take me for?
You're too short for that gesture.
Your name is not Eve Harrington.
A matter of opinion.
She was a liar, she was a liar!
I had to get in, to meet Margo!
Then say so.
I won't play tonight.
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
I'm tired. I want to go home.
That isn't a waiter, my dear.
Let's go sit by the piano.
We never met. That's why.
Claudia dear, come closer.
Feeling better, my dear?
Tell me this.
Answer me this.
In my case it's necessary.
I'm giving her a very high-class party.
She was magnificent.
You mustn't worry about your little charge.
Why so remote, Addison?
Miss Caswell got lucky too late.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Eve was incredibly modest.
Bill...
Bill!
You've already met.
Good luck, genius...
Macbeth.
When? When are you going to do it?
Nothing?
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
Hi.
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
Take care of yourself out there...
Knit me a muffler.
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
Happy birthday, darling...
It's a good thought.
Happy little housewife...
Need any help?
Don't let me kill the point.
Thank you.
No heart to burn.
It's all over.
What fire and music?
Addison-!
No, I'll tell it to you!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Bill...  ... where are you going?
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
It's only for the license.
Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
There goes Eve.
Never try to outguess Margo.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Hello, what's your name?
You said forty-seven minutes.
Why?
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
Ah...
Thanks for your help... good luck.
Yes. Yes, it does.
Don't run away, Bill.
Lemme fix you a drink.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
The bed looks like a dead animal act.
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
You need new girdles.
How do you do, my dear.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
You bought the new girdles a size smaller.
Adorable.
Birdie-
I'll tell you how.
You all put together?
Who are you?
Please don't have me arrested, please!
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
It's after one now.
That's the door.
So there you are.
I'm going to take you to Margo...
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
Hello, Miss Channing.
If I only knew how...
You're not going, are you?
Good night, Eve.
Now who's show up at this hour?
There should be a new word for happiness.
Mrs. Richards.
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
May I have your coat?
Eve.
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
I've got a lot to say.
Eve... don't cry.
Eve.
I think I know...
Addison wants me to play it.
A part in a play.
She knows enough not to be here.
Congratulations, Eve.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
No, thank you.
How'd hear about it?
I guess it started back home.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
Back to Copacabana.
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr.
Well.
Did you see it here in New York?
No, don't go...
Stick around.
What - again?
Don't get up.
If you'd like.
I'd like to hear it.
The hors d'oeuvres are here.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
Hi.  Hello, darling-
It's the tight girdle that does it.
Relax, kid.
Well.
Dear Birdie.
Would you like a drink?
Margo, really...
That little place just two hours form New York.
How much time have we?
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
Do you want it on?
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
What about Bill?
About Eve.
Margo.
With tears?
I remember.
How was the concert?
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
Coming?
Lloyd, what happened...?
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
What time is it?
Lloyd, be careful...
But it can't be!
You'll break your neck on that ice.
Eve did mention the play, you know.
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything.
Well of all-
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
- well? What happened?
What's so funny?
Who is it? What's it all about?
I didn't think you would!
Have you forgotten about Eve?
Honey chili had a point.
Would you, really? How sweet-
How about calling it a night?
I like that girl.
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish.
There you are, both of you.
Who's left out there?
How's the new one coming?
She's your understudy.
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve.
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
It's been quite a night.
Yes, sir.
Very discreet.
... and Bill.
That depends.
Hello..
"Liebestraum."
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Margo.
Here you are, Maxie dear.
You get quick action, don't you?
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
Carl?
You heard?
All right, what do we know?
Hey?
--what do you think?--
You think they are confidential?
July of '71.
That was fun.  What now?
What's that?
Goddamnit--
See her?  Get anything?
Who's first?
This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
We understand your problem--
I hate both parties.
Republican?
Did he just say what I think he said?
I  couldn't believe what she told me.
How do you want to handle Sloan?
Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?
--there had to be a White House overseer--
Goddamnit--
What would you have done?
You think we're being set up?
He'll give us a sworn statement.
I think that's him.
Nah.  Maybe.
--Jesus--
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
Woodward?
You overslept?
What does it say?
I'll never get out of here in time.
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.
Sorry.
Hi, it's me.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
Mr. Dardis does call in every so often?
Donald Segretti?
I'm Carl Bernstein.
Do you feel much about the things you did?
--you got more than one source?--
Speak.
--no--
--and we got a guy in Justice--
What's a real denial?
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
Hey... very tense.
I thought you had to get to Miami.
You've really got to go.
One minute but then--
Try and understand this.
But they both worked at the White House?
Right.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
What happens when the baby comes?
I really can't talk now--
--I'm not your source on that--
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
Same kind of crap--
What's this?
Look--why would the Republicans do it?
Just tell me his title.
--I saw him. He verifies.
I got Clawsen on hold--
--I'm sure--
We can't talk inside either?
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Mr. Caddy?
Mr.
They are not my clients.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
My turn to keep you waiting.
What?
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?
Your name, please.
And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
...go on, go on...
What'd you get on W.House?
Who's Charles Colson?
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman.
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
So?
--who you got?--
Anything?
--has any of them got an ax?--
More denunciations?
What else have you got?
--no--
--which Young?
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
Mr. Sloan?
Does "they" mean the White House?
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
Go on.
A boy or a girl?
Hi.
What the hell was that?
I'll do it.
Good work, Ostreicher.
Christ!
Great evening, isn't it?
What did you just say?
Look, Chris.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Good morning gentleman.
Ah, Stifler's mom!
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
All right, I got some scotch.
I had no idea you'd be this good!
This is your plan, Finch?
This.  Right now.
Of course, Finch.  What?
What do you suppose they're saying?
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Me too.  For the most part.
Not bad, Chris.
Oh sure.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Um...Chris --
Alright, cool.
Nice car.
What?!
Why are you doing this?
Hi...
Uh...my dad's the manager.
So we're gonna be close next year?
...I've got this lacrosse game.
What about the game?!
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
Oz, it's okay, I know.
Hmm.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
He likes it.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough.
No comment.
Oooh, yeah.
Give it to me!  Yes!
Don't you love my sexy body?!
You're so big!
Fuck me!  Yes!
And you said...
There's our man.
What about you?
Gotta go.
Ow, what the hell?
Like a bet?
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
I have no idea.
Hey, where's Finch?
You can send me the address too.
Did I miss anything?!
But, but -- what would I do?
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Holy shit.
Hey, minuteman.
How do you know that?
Yeah?
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Alright, how do you guys stand?
Back out?
No, no that's fine.
What the heck is this?
Can I come in?
Okay.
I know, Dad.
Dad!  I know!
Jim?
Dad, please stop.
Son.  This lady's here for you.
Dad.
Hold on.
You know, at band camp?
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
Yeah, bring it on!
...excuse me?!
This'll do.
Illegal channels?
You guys got the Latin homework?
This was remade?  Into what?
Who cares?
Shortstop.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
You can do that?
I still think you're okay.
There it is.
It's true.
What's up, fellas?
You did it.
Yes.
No...you...go...ahead.
Yes.  No.  Yes.
Okay.
So you need to change, right?
James!
Uh...
Jim...
You are done, James.
Did you see this?
No, not again.
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Ho-lee shit.
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky.
"Dear Ms.
Oh, Kev.
Let me know.
Vicky, wait.
I was being selfish.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Like how?
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
Kevin.
Hey...
About the other day...I've been thinking.
And I want to make things perfect for you.
Now?!
See -- this is the nicest room.
You comfortable?
You sure you're comfortable?
Yeah Vick?
Victoria...I love you.
That was a great night.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
Say that again, Kevin?
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Hey.  I got another question for you.
Then she said -- she loves me.
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Contact, dude.
Feeling better, Oz?
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
So does your tongue cramp up?
What reputation?
Okay, explain.
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Kevin, it was just a --
...Guess what?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Wow.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
NOVA!!
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
I think you need your balls reattached.
<u>Yeah</u>!
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Our last game is this Saturday.
Here, babe.
Really?
You know.
Hanging is nice.
Let's face it.
Merde! Just missed!
Geez, I feel bad for him.
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
Merde! I can't believe this!
Either way works for us...
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
God. How can you eat like that?
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Ha ha.
Ahh!
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Hey, you can't kick me!
Ha-ha!
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Sure. I can follow that.
Salots! Shitfucker!
You must not have known him very well.
Medusa... What's this?
Professor Claude Rousel.
I'm serious.
What good can you do?
So you came after all.
Andy! Holy shit!
Thank God!
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
You have to be a hero.
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Come on Serafine.
What about food?
What about your glasses?
Don't you want to change?
Shit!
Like I should talk.
This looks familiar...
Serafine...
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh?
Hello?
I'm not alright.
You two faced bastard.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
What makes you so sure this will work?
They're coming!
I saw him.
Are you crazy!?
What the fuck!? You too!?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Holy mother of God...
Andy?
You made me go there.
Here!
We don't both have to die.
We can't stop him.
I know where he'll go.
Didn't even have to ask.
No wonder he let her go.
God. I can't believe it.
What does it say?
Whoa...
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Okay. Be careful.
Oh God. Shit...
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
There's something down there!
Pull over! Now!
It's you.
Where's the ADM?
Saint Severin?
Don't be an idiot!
Claude...?
The ADM. Let's go.
What's the problem?
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Another step and he's dead!
You bastard!
Ha. Some wonder drug...
Nothing's happening!
You recognize her?
We know you were with her.
He was a good man.
Merde.
I always wanted to do that.
It's horrible.
Psychic awareness. Right.
Andy...
You didn't know?
Not you too -
You're exactly right, Andy.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Great.
Eight o'clock.
It killed him.
Uncle Terrence?
Undead.
Oh shit!
Where is it! Please!
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Jesus...
Maybe we should go now.
Yeah.
I'm afraid she's not so lucky.
Fuck you!
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Shit. I feel sick.
Okay.
Enough. Cut him loose.
Andy, stop!
Andy!
No, it's no cure.
What've you got?
Merde.
Here.
Well?
Twelve thirty-six a.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
You better follow that McDermott kid.
Saint Severin...
Why were you so late tonight
"Together in Paris"!
Hurry, Grandmama!
Are you running away?
Where is your home, Anya?
Anya!
Who did you hear it from?
Providing travel papers is illeagal!
Noooo....
Is everyone all right?
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Did I tell you that?
No! I look ridiculous!
Oh, Meetoo!
Fortunately, I am to be married.
Ouch!  That really hurt!
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
Why do you want to go to Paris?
You never thought of the possibility?
By pulling my hair?!
I'm going to stretch my legs
Come on up!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
Come on!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
Every Russian family has one..
What a beautiful ship!
You said you wouldn't laugh!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Oh! I'm sorry...
Nervous?
I'm so scared...
Anya, wait!
Dmitri?
Don't let me go!
Who are you, child?
Do you remember this?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
Anastasia!
Don't you, child?
Dmitri didn't want the money?
Why does everyone have to act that way?
What?
Trust me, it's her!
Hey, she's just a kid.
I'm getting a chest cold..
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
What was that?
It's her.
Hurry up with those papers.
You're a princess...
What do we do now?
See? The Princess is under there ...
How is our current financial status?
The "Odessa Dunk"?
We did it!
Life is funny, isn't it.
But this invitation came from the Empress herself!
So where will you go?
So.
What do you want?!
I'll show you!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
Empress, no!
You are the boy ...
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Hey, you on television?
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
Can I have your autograph?
Hey!
Who's on television?
Singer!
You're a thinking person.
It's an important issue.
You're like New York.
Yes.
Allison.
It-but it-it.
We've been through this.
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.
Bad mood?
Two minutes, Alvy.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
Stop it, Alvy!
Oh!
Alvy, I...
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
Well, maybe we should just call the police.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
Oh, God!
Great!
He was creepy.
Hi. Hi, hi.
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
So sorry.
So, how long do you know Janet?
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
For yuh.
All right.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Oh, you see an analyst?
Sylvia Plath.
God bless.
Well, I don't know.
I was awful.
Hey, listen, listen.
We can digest our-
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
M'm, that was so nice.
Hey?
I've a very pessimistic view of life.
Look, look at that guy.
Look at these guys.
You see, like you and I...
You know what I mean?
Whatta you mean?
How is it any different?
Does this sound like a good course?
No, don't be silly.
What are you doing?
Really?
Oh, you have my body.
You're so sure about it.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
Hey, don't knock masturbation!
I'm home!
She said, "Will it change my wife.
Adult education is such junk!
What's- It's me, open up.
What is this?
Two?
Okay, let me have this.
Hey, what is this?
Oh, Jesus, really?
Alvy, let's never break up again.
Happy birthday.
Here's a real present.
You were-you were sensational.
Remember, we had that thing.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
...I'm thrilled.
God.
God, it's so clean out here.
Excuse me.
Christ!
Yeah, this place is great.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Oh, good. Okay.
It's wonderful.
Alvy, uh, let's face it.
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
God.
You look very pretty.
Alvy.
What'd I do?
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?
Here you are. There's people out there.
Alvy, don't!
Oh, I'm sorry!
Hey, come on, it's quiet now.
Where are you going?
Man, that's great.
Probably on their first date, right?
I never read that.
Oh.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
This is a great house, really.
Charlie Chaplin.
What are you making such a big deal about?
Sixteen years ago.
I distinctly heard it.
Yeah, watch the road!
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
I have some very good memories there.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
Oh.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
What's the matter?
You like this house, Max?
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
The one with the V.P.L.
Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
Hey, you guys are wearin' white.
Twins, Max.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
Let 'im drop dead!
You fired the cleaning woman?
All right-so we can afford it.
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
That was fun.
We went over to the swap meet.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
M'mmm.
Oh.
Oh. What about?
Uh.
Oh.
Yeah.
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
Did you see permits?
So who won?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
What's that?
Can we... one at a time?
It's going.  It's going.
Isn't Skye amazing?
Poor Mac.
She already has.
So they tell me.
Mac?
You don't have any clothes on.
Honey?
What a fucking day!
I'm not.
Why didn't you bring him?
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
What is that thing?
Let's get the kids.
Thanks for coming.
Would you leave us alone right now?
He's gonna miss his flight.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
Take good care of it.
I'm the hired help.
That for us?
Directing suits you.
Escape hatch.
So?
What is it?
The suspense is killing me.
Stupid tart.
You need to call your dad.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Time.
There's a test, you know.
Are you my big brave boy?
I call that a perfect day.
Go.
He's okay, Clair.
I'm fine, babe.
I'm fine, babe.
We closed.
Joe officially owns No.
I suppose.
Not millions.
He gets huge advances on his novels.
You're out of your mind.
Take your time, Jer.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
No luck.
Happy anniversary, baby.
I love you.
What did you get me?
Kiss the back of my knees.
What?
No.  Did you?
Don't get it.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Of course we do.
Otis!  No barking!
In the kitchen.
Yes.
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
Two minutes.
Still champions.
It's an unfair advantage.
Not properly watered.
Dolphins.  Great.
I think we should all take it tonight.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.
Don't be so sure.
Fuck you.
Otis!!!!
Cal, too?
You think this was to hurt you?
Alright, good.
I can't got tonight.
No.
Happy anniversary.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat.
I know.
Panes!  How are you?
What's a sign for that?
Coffee?
We have a gift?
I love gifts.
The infamous dog?
You lose this?
You got your DP?
Please, Ryan.
Something soft.
Your Eames table is incredible.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
Easy tiger.
Would you sign it for me.
I need to leave you now.
Are you okay?
I've never done this before.
Lemon or raspberry?
Ryan's really angry with me.
That's very nice.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
How do you do, Skye?
I think there are sixteen there.
Of course it's alright.
What?
I didn't say a word.
I was faking it.
Jesus Christ.
How's he doing?
Ryan.
Well, yes, actually.
I love it here.
Are you making an ass of yourself?
Ready to go?
Ryan, you've got to come!
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
We could hardly say no.
Ryan!
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
I'm sorry.
Come on in.
And I'm overwhelmed.
Is there space here?
I was impressed.
Otis!
Good, you brought your violin.
Panes is here!
She's even better looking in the flesh.
Oh, Jesus, Panes.
Everyday.
Shit!
So how are you really doing, Panes?
How's the movie going?
Thank you, Panes.
Panes?
What did I do?
Yes.
Thank you.
Monica and Ryan.
I didn't know you had this.
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
Happy anniversary.
You don't need to do that.
Enough about me.
Oh my God!
He's a novelist.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
Well, I don't trust her.
What do you mean, thank God?
Don't try and change the subject.
Sorry Azteca.
Break's over.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.
Someone who follows his heart!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
So, um...how was your day?
He's.
What a bunch of losers.
Are you sure this is a real dance?
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
And you are...?
No, General.
You dance...
He was a worker.
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Theoretically, yes.
Water...water...
We're going to die!
This lake is huge!
Out here I'm just what?
Face it, Z, we're lost!
We've found it!
Come on, Z.
Why do they have you tied up here?
Z!  what are you doing?
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
I felt the same way before I got married.
Who is that idiot?
Bala!
You new, kid?
You just stick by old Barbatus.
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?
Don't be scared, kid.
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
Z!  Over here!
Barbatus!
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1!
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
What are you doing?
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
So tell me.  Where's Z?
No -- you -- you don't understand!
May I cut in?
What's this?
No snacking between meals!
I feel.
...I should?
Ask me why we're so successful.
What do you see out there?
You see?
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
Did you see that?
Weaver, they're career girls.
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
Time to cut a rug, Z!
Get real, Z!
You have to help me.
Wear this.
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!
I'm getting lonely.
This the place?
You sure this is a good idea?
Not there.  Under the mat.
So this is your mother's apartment?
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
All right -- I'll tell him.
What gives, Baxter?
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
What did you do to your hair?
Say, you got a lulu.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
Twenty-seven.
I hope everything goes all right.
Good night.
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.
Marry Christmas.
One more?
You all right? What's the matter?
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
Here.
What is it?
Your phone.
Don't you remember?
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
I'm so ashamed.
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
Here. How about some breakfast?
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
When are you coming home?
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
Why not?
You sure you want to throw that card?
Who was that?
There's a call for you --
Are you all right?
What are you doing with that?
Tennis racquet?
You can't leave yet.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik.
No, thanks.
Are we dressing for dinner?
Shall I light the candles?
I see you bought some napkins.
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
How's everything at the apartment?
Oh.
Are you all right?
Where are you going?
What about Mr. Sheldrake?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik?
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
Baxter?
Would you mind repeating the question?
Where is your apartment?
Where are you going, Baxter?
This?
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Morning, gentlemen.
I like the way you handled that.
To me?
Hello?
You like?  It's all yours.
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover.
Now you're being bright?
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Baxter?
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
No, no -- just had a little accident.
On account of me.
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
That Kubelik -- boy!
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
So long, Baxter.
Hi, Baxter.
You can't come in.
Look, you can't stay here.
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?
Hiya, Buddy-boy.
Make it thirty minutes.
Oh, Buddy-boy.
Dear Mr.
Good evening, Baxter.
She going to be all right, Doc?
What are you going to do, Doc?
Want to tell me what happened?
What's her name?
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
Any of that coffee left?
How do you spell her last name?
Why do you want to know, Doc?
Help yourself.
How's the patient?
Where are you moving to?
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
You like Castro?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Say, this is Snugsville.
Not so rough, honey.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
I see.
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
That guy really must've belted him.
Sleeping pills.
Tell me again -- what's my name?
Do you know who this is?
Please -- just let me sleep.
What for?
You fool -- you damn fool.
Hi.
Well -- thank you.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
How long has it been -- a month?
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
I have that date -- remember?
Where are we going, Jeff?
How could I be so stupid?
Oh.
Okay.
Coming?
Hello, Jeff.
Are you there, Fran?
Sorry it took me so long on the phone.
Please, Sylvia!
Some setup you got here.
You got to watch those things.
Where do you live?
Yes?
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!
Did you have a nice Christmas?
We need all our fuel anyway.
You're out of your skull --
Two whole drums --
We've been attacked.
Who the hell are you?
How about a drink ?
Winning the war by yourself.
That's good gin.
Were you Longe Range Recon --
That's quite an array of ribbons...
So what happened ?
Holy shit.
Arch light.
Chef.
What do you see?
And the grass?
That's a light down there --
Charlie?
What are we doing here?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
This is evil -- evil, Captain.
Can I go get those mangos now?
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
Elevate Lance, in the tree.
What'd he say?
Flood.
I met the P.
Smoke !
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there.
What're you trying to say, Captain --
Well, get in there.
Get in there !
What the hell is it?
They're not Cong.
I --
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Listen.
Will they attack?
Anybody see some smoke ?
What cat  ?
They nail him for it bad ?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
What do you want ?
I only met Kurtz once.
You didn't like him.
What does that mean ?
Our Recon flight ?
Spooky.
What -- happened here.
Who is he?
How did they know?
Yeah.
Captain B.
No, sir.
Yeah.
I thought he was a lame.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
American weapons?
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.
Upriver?
Two of my men deserted last night.
What's your name, sailor ?
It's an honor to meet you Lance.
Where've you been riding, Lance?
Good swell.
They far enough?
You smell that.  You smell that?
The wind --
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
Change.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.
Fucking savages.
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.
It's gonna blow this place out.
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
Why did you come to ... my province.
Do you know me?
Yeah, I can see that.
I said get the fuck out !
Do you?
You've gone crazy.
No -- I don't want to sleep.
Gimme water.
How did we get here?
Go away -- hide yourself.
Did you know him very well?
Maybe he'll get tubed.
What's that?
He'll kill us.
Are you finished surfing?
No -- no, Captain.
This one , Lance?
You hear it again?
What's this tiger shit?
The other one --
What?
Captain Willard?
This boat's a mess.
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
Who are you?
Do you miss your home, Captain?
What will you do after the war?
Are you warm, Captain?
So that's it.
What if I say no.
What show ?
That's 27, sir.
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
Where's your chief supply officer?

How long have you been up north?
My dad was a Navy doctor.
What about you -- why come back?
You should know something.
Have you talked to Eric?
What happened here?
He's coming around fine.
What are you doing?
Stay here.
Thanks.
I'll go into town with you.
Did you catch Corbett?
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
Winter.
High-tech in the wilderness.
Let's go.
Be careful, okay?
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.
You're hurt.
Technology in the wilderness.
Leave it here.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Go ahead.
Ben Corbett?
Desmond.
Does he have people?
Surviving is what I know --
Been driving long?
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Stay put!
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.
Be my guest.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Have to get these wet things off.
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
Told you I'm fine!
Stay still.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
Nome?
Don't judge me.
What do you know about people?
Don't push me..!
They think you're in Fairbanks.
Maybe.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
You were real resourceful out there.
Emergency transmitter?
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Answer and I'll shoot!
Snow's to their advantage, kid.
Can you walk?
How come you didn't let him shoot me?
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Relax.
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
All this for laying traps on private land?
You better get some sleep.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.
I need to rent a cabin.
Mr. Desmond!
If Corbett's men find out --
What's wrong?
You don't care enough about Sam to --
Neff, you know better than this...
Alleged killer.
Bet you're right.
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Hey, Sam, look over there.
I'm too old for this shit.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
Why the smirk?
He saw you and Corbett come in...
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
LeMalle.
There you go.
Go easy.
Thought that door was open last night...
You hear me?  Ben?
...Ben never sent a signal.
Meaning he'll need a plane.
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
It's Sam Wilder!
There's what they're waiting on!
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
What is it you want? What?
How was it talking to him?
Call me as soon as you're settled.
Stop it!
I'm sorry.
Do you love me?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.
How long has he been having problems?
Doc!
I'm starving.
I know. He's just the best.
What's with the plastic picnic ware?
He's gotta fight to breathe.
So what are you doing with a dog?
You know he's a little dog.
And if I had to guess by your eyes.
I'm hungry.
This is not a sexist thing.
What about your mother?
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
Uh, Udall?
The doctors had your billing address.
You waiting for me to say something?
I'm not kidding.
So you'll be at work?
What's this?
Getting loud, getting loud.
So. Anything else?
No... no thank you notes.
Nice of you... thank you.
Hello?
Hi.
I was going to do that for you.
Thanks, Melvin.
Hey -- you let him...
That's not true.
My son was outside playing soccer.
Stop asking everyone.
You wanna dance?
No.
And mean it...
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
So how are you doing with those pills?
You don't owe me that.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.
Here are the keys to my apartment.
Hello.
Okay to say something now?
What do you want, Melvin?
I wasn't asleep!!
Boyfriend?
It feels a little confined here.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
No!
Was this supposed to be your room?
Can you not be violent?
Good night.
I've got to sketch you.
We held each other.
But what about...
One night with me!
I love you...  Let him take you home.
What the heck are those for?
Help!
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
Hey, hey.
So, what's new anyway?
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
Hey, where are you going?
How's Verdell doing?
Simon's home.
She's nice.
What?
Take my car -- a convertible.
Okay.
Good evening.
Actually, I don't think so.
Shall I get her for you?
How you doing, great one?
No. Please, don't force him.
Sorry. What are those cards?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now.
Frank loves you.
Is he dead yet?
Okay.
Mr.
Which color was that?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Yeeeess!!!
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Did you... do something to him?
That's some face they left hanging on you.
Thank you.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Would you leave now, please?
I brought you Chinese soup.
I haven't been sleeping.
I, uh.
That's very thoughtful.
Well, I always painted.
Not it at all, really.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
I get why you're angry.
... Now he's going to want to stay.
What are you talking about?
Good-bye.
I told you to go on in.
I think you gotta camp it here...
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
Sorry, didn't know you were awake.
You going to come talk to me or not?
What did she say?
What's wrong?
I can't resist.
How do you write women so well?
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Nothing.
So you're practically finished, huh?
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Why are you doing this?
Is there a problem?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
Where you from?
Why?  What happened?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
Boy, that's fucking genius.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
Hey.
You don't have to tell me that.
Oh!
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
So what happens now?
Okay.
What are you doing?
No, no.
How'd you know?
Listen to me, Bain.
Five million dollars?
Did you see how I did that?
Game over, bitch!
I'm on the scent.
Michael?
Such language in front of a lady.
How in the fuck do you know that?
Hi.
Good afternoon.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
Where have you been, Robert?
Send the file.
What?
Who?
How did he know?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
Deadline?
Who is the mark?
Hello, Robert.
I know what happened.
I give a fuck?
Is this how it went, Nick?
You think this is a fucking joke?
A player?
What?
Get on the expressway.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
Bullshit.
Twenty large?  That's all?
Now what?
You want me to pump?
Okay.  How did you find me?
Nikita?
You're one of them, aren't you?
Who is that other guy?
I don't need the money.
Oh Jesus Jesus...
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
No.
With computers.
Had?
It looks like white's game.
He was... taken.
I killed him.
Is that what you wanted to hear?
It.
Do you have a passport?
Hey, where are you?
I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.
That's where he'll be.
No.
Do you think about the game?
I'm kind of tired.
Do you think he's here?
What do you think he's doing?
Breakfast.
I know what you are thinking.
You should knock.
Where did you learn it?
Two way?
I paid a lot for these.
This is the bank.
You'll be here.
He can't.
What is it?
Do you have ulcers?
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
Did you think they were newlyweds?
She is married, but not to him.
What are you doing?
Can I ask you something?
Yes.
Were you attracted to me right away?
Martin.
Four minutes.
Was nice.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
I wasn't watching television.
Hi.  Did you call --
I prefer it like this.
Would you like a drink?
Why are you working today?
You're very good at this aren't you?
For what?
Do you ever regret things you've done?
Do you ever think about starting over?
Then, I'll sail alone.
Is that all you want?
Thank you.
How much farther?
I think I've heard of you.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Can I ask you something?
Everyone handles it differently.
Look at that.
You wish to close this account today?
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
What are you having?
Cheers Katka!
So how's your work?
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
What is it with that Josh guy?
How to make a buck!
You guys having a go a me or what?
Anything in it?
Who's your friend?
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
Oh yeah, what's that?
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Okay, we're listening.
Okay, it's in here somewhere.
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
That stinks!
Just two things.
Wow!
No, why?
I'm an idiot?
It must be on the other side of this.
I'd love to get in there.
Need any disks?
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Moved on to plumbing huh?
I thought you were gonna throw these?
Perfect!
Let's split.
Afternoon!
Like a hand?
Do you think anyone will really come here?
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
Red or white?
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
Thanks.
My God! What happened?
Don't tell me you really are in love?
Chris, can you do me a favour?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
Chris! Tell me some good news.
I stopped by your office.
It's...42 56 76 .
God, I think I need a holiday.
What about me?
Time for lunch I think.
Yeah, no problem.
I can't go with him.
You don't understand, I can't!
I made a deal with Josh.
Take this exit.
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
It's that one isn't it.
There shooting at something.
Good morning.
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
Turned Czech huh?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
Why don't you read something after the break?
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
A word of advice my celibate friend.
It's just talk, he's drunk.
I don't want to get in trouble.
I'm not going in Doug.
Doug you said you wouldn't be long.
Kat, I'm in paradise.
I hope you're going to invite me in?
She's tired.
I want you so bad.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
No, I love you, really.
I thought for sure they would catch me.
Will it help to get you out?
If you get out can we be together again.
I don't understand, it's your home?
Forget about me Kat.
Yeah, for sure.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Hi, want to take up dancing?
I'll do my best.
They'll do it.
Okay?
You mean you don't know, Henry!
And take Jiri with you?
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
Will they free me?
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
I thought I'd help out.
Seems a shame!
Why are you doing all this, what for?
Shall I wash these out?
Is it dry?
What would you like, beer?
I'd better get you to a hospital.
Who you saving the dishes for?
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Did you take your things over to my place?
Better than you.
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
Where did you steal the car?
This is your doing?
Why did you break into that particular building?
Enjoying our hospitality?
Good try Mr.
What is it you want?
I'm not sure it's possible.
And the students?
Would you like your things now?
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
We had a deal!
Hey Doug, where you been?
No, just a drill.
Sure!
So, he didn't fire you?
When the hell did you write that?
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
Josh!
Yeah, so I hear.
I think we should be going honey.
I don't want to go.
Come on Holly!
That's my bag.
Shall I look after the rest?
Will you come home and forget all about him?
Why are there still such headlines?
You are responsible...What has happened?
What are you an idiot!
So, who is in the building?
Have you lost all control of this city?
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
So go dance.
She's coming over here...
She asleep?
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
What if they expel you?
I'm not hanging.
Your father dropped off an extra check.
Out with Belinda?
You saw him?
You look nice. I should have dressed.
To see your father?
A late night or an early morning?
Honey, some of this is.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I told him to leave me alone.
I have no idea what to say.
What are you doing here?
Everything's being done but it's not enough.
Where is he?
I'm thinking.
Hypotheticals --
Don't call him a dipshit.
The address?!
Deranged.
She's like some Puritan.
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
Landon!
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
Who are you?
I'm very sorry --
Get yourself a glass.
He goes to my father's church.
Because, growing up, books were my world.
You mean care what you say?
'I hope your dreams come true.'
'Is it really me?'
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
That's deep --
I know you don't want help.
Yeah.
Fire is like a living thing.
What the -- ?!
What's with the friggin numbers?
You got some kind of list?
I'll take a chance.
So what else is on this list?
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
Like you'd know.
No problem --
I'll get something for us to drink --
I know. Don't say anything.
Because I try to be nice to people?
What is that?
Saturn. Beautiful.
Looking for intelligent life?
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
You're really into God, right?
Like in a church painting.
You have to believe to have faith.
He doesn't trust you.
The play's going to be really good.
You're not in a very good mood.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
Oh. Just not at school...
He okay?
You were great the other night.
I haven't been nice to you.
People can see.
Maybe you inspire me.
All of it.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
It's a start.
So you're talking to me?
What does that mean?!
Hey.
She great or what?
Like fire.
Yes. But not as a date date.
Is there a rush?
Your turn.
Before we do this.
Excuse me?
The cells in our bodies are always changing.
Stand right here.
You're acting like a crazy person.
We can measure wind.
I don't understand...
I might do it wrong.
You make me feel...
Assholes. This happen to you?
What's wr--?
Come on.
How do you know this place?
What'd you tell your father?
When did you build this?
So what do you want to see?
A Thermos of hot coffee.
Are you trying to seduce me?
Ergo?
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
From citizen high to citizen low.
One of your secrets.
You're worried about your college applications.
You're going to take a year off?
Jamie --
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
Are you frightened?
Help me live until I die?
Nope.
Slim Jim?
What are you thinking?
I've talked to your father.
Whatever you need.
You know how to waltz??
How you doing?
'What is a friend?
'Love is always patient and kind.
How're you doing?
It's gone now.
I'll talk to your father.
Can I -- go out?
Will you do something for me?
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
By accident --
What's Landon Carter up to?
Did you give him a gift?
I'm asking how much.
Maybe.
No you didn't.
You're in the play?
Apropos of nothing.
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
I care for her.
This week.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
How about your family?
We didn't tell him any different for years --
Her doctors have.
Landon. You go on home.
I've almost finished the rocker.
You have materials for the side bearings?
You know about this stuff?
You've been well?
You're marrying again.
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
Like you'd make it to June.
Now I can do what I want.
Shall I give you a few ideas?
No way.
For Jefferson High. For books.
Your grades for fall semester.
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
So what did we just make?
This... is the number one single?
Morning Dick.
What's N.R.C.?
I've been calling you for five minutes!
How was school today?
How old are you?
Here's your jacket!
It's polyester.
Huh?
Hi, Marty.
You remember me...?
Then you'll be going to school here.
What time does school start around here?
George!
Hi, Marty!
Are you all right, Marty?
I think I know exactly what you mean.
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Uh, hi, Eileen.
Dad, you seen the drill?
Fine..
No, Chinese food is fine.
The sunrise? What for?
You've gotta ask her to the dance!
George, she's beautiful, right?
What do I say?
Oh, no!
What is that?
'Bike fine point?'
Okay.
You mean, you're gonna --
Your line, George!
Maybe if I used my left....
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
Yes, that's my name.
You have a name?
Who, me?
Operator...
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Good evening, one said.
What, am I radioactive or something?
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Okay, Martin.
What?!
Professor Brown!
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!
Eight thirty.
Catch you later! 
But Professor --
No, Marty.
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
The plutonium!
Of course.
A gold mine?
Marty, that would alter history.
Professor? Professor Brown?
Professor, you time machine works!
He will be.
Pardon me?
How did you know?
Professor.
You answered the door!
An atomic bomb.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
I know.
Look, it's not a big deal!
Where did you get this?
The test is this Monday!
In a manner of speaking, yes.
That's all taken care of.
Look.
There's no way of knowing.
You didn't?
Thanks for everything, Pro.
What year is this?
Hop in, Marty, .
Obviously!  
Pretty, isn't it?
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
Sweet and what?
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick.
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
Suzy!
Hi. where's Cato?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Catch!
How you doing, Cato?
What you been doing?
Where'd you get them antlers?
Yeah, I guess.
That's what he told you, huh?
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
Don't you ever get bored around here?
What'd they look like?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
You ever held another job before?
Oh yeah?
We did it, Ray.
Well, Kit...
Sure is pretty.
Listen.
Hi.
What do you think you're doing?
What for?
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Hi, I'm Kit.
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers.
You still in school?
That's my father. I got to run.
Hi.
You want to go for a ride?
You're a redhead.
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
What a nice place.
My stomach's growling.
Somebody else is going to get it.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
You know what I think?
Don't call me stupid.
I came in the front.
Are you sure?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
How you doing?
I found a lid.
Look at all this junk.
Is he upset?
Whatcha looking in there for?
Think I got 'em?
What'd you put him in there for?
You tired?
Don't.
I'd like to get out of here.
That's Montana over there.
Why not?
Everybody loves trout.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
Never mind.
What?
You smoke Pall Mall?
Boy.
Have you got a better idea?
Course it's too bad about your dad.
Hi.
What's that?
Hi.
Sorry to barge in on you.
Hi, whatcha doing?
Yes.
You're my friend, aren't you?
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
You didn't walk out here.
Who are you?
Okay, friend. Start running.
Hi.
Think I'll take the juice?
You tossed my hat out the window.
So we'll help.
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.
She gotta be kiddin', right?
There's another one we owe 'em.
See 'em?
Smells fermented.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Then what?
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
That's me.
What crate?
You okay?
You're a welcome sight...
Apache?
We will, old fried, we will.
Anybody we know?
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Everybody ready?
Hey, any lock can be picked.
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Planet 10?
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
Dead.  Damnit!
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
What is this thing?  A fighter?
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
Pull up!
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
Where're you goin'?
And they got Penny!  Look!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.
Got a casualty list?
Raise your hand...where?
Did you say..."Peggy"?
Nobody's a nobody.
This song's for Peggy.
What're you doing here?
Was she pretty?
Did you have family there--?
You keep an eye on it.
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
Never.
You've got your six guns strapped on.
Stay here, I'll be back.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo!
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
Not too terrific, sir.
What?
Where was it, John O'Connor?
Not here!  No Overthruster!
But John Whorfin said kill her.
Buckaroo, come in.
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
What's his problem?
Pick those up, Reno.
It's a spittin' image.
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
The name's Reno.
Any sign of Buckaroo?
We're waiting for the Jet Car.
So where's Buckaroo?
Unscheduled surgery.
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.
Is, uh... Is he okay?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
I'll tell Bill you dropped by.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
I see.
Let him go.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
If you could, I'd 
Hello, Barton.
Now that's all right, Barton.
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Well... THIS.
...This'll sometimes help.
Am I?
I'll try to slip out.
How d'ya like your room!
...Hello.
I write.
No, I  I didn't mean to sound 
How long you been up there, Fink?
Ever talk to him?
Yeah, he's funny that way.
...No.
Well that's what he said.
Could you come back later?
I beg your pardon?
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
...Still, I must say.
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
I'm a writer, Mr.
Don't worry about it.
...Look, you're confused?
What do you think this is?
I don't understand-
I thought you were going to join us.
We have to talk a little business.
...I guess I'm sprouting off again.
Barton?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
Sound a little what?
... You got a glass?
Yeah, just a nip.
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
...Is the egg showing or what?!
That's okay, Charlie.
Caught me trying to be fancy!
You're all right, Charlie.
Howdy, neighbor.
Oh, yeah.
Ah, doctors.
...Got a sweetheart?
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
...What's the expression  me myself and I.
...This must be boring you.
It's okay, it's okay.
I hope these are your shoes.
Jesus, what a day I've had.
Jesus, what a day.
...Did I say rude?
...Listen to me belly-achin'.
How did you know about that?
And there's hope for you too, Charlie.
...Your room does that too?
...Can I come in?
Barton. Are you all right?
Get a grip on yourself, brother.
Jesus... They can tell that...
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
Jesus... You're leaving.
Jesus, Charlie, I...
It's okay... It's okay...
...I just don't know what... to do
Sure, Charlie.
It's more than I've got.
You'll be back?
But Charlie  why me? Why 
...Where did we put him?
...Well Bart, which is it?
Yeah... rye whiskey?

Yes sir.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle.
F-I-N-K.

...Okay
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
...Those your only bags?
L.A.P.D.

Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Big fuckin' deal.
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
He teach you to do it?
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
...Thanks Lou.
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Mr. Lipnik, I 
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!
Yes, Colonel.
Okay.
Where were you tonight?
Yeah, I was drinking.
There's no smoking in this building.
We got a call from Berkeley P.
Take care, you hear?
The boat blew.
I can get my butt kicked for this.
How are you, Nick?
So -- how are things?
How is your -- personal life?
How about the booze?
How's not smoking?
You okay?
What are you doing here?
What was she like?
We were in some of the same classes.
I need a cigarette.
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
You did it for me.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
Beth.
What is your problem?
What is this interest you've got in her?
What do you want, Nick?
She told you, didn't she?
I did dye my hair.
She's really sick you know.
Why did you change your name?
You should do something about this lock.
What are you doing here?
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
Don't!
I'm De...
How long were you dating him?
How long were you having sex with him?
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
Do you have a cigarette?
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
I told you -- I quit.
What's your new book about?
Did I miss something?
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
You like playing games, don't you?
How did you feel when he died?
Even though you were fucking him.
Sure.
I'm tired.
I passed.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
Am I... disturbing you?
Would you like a drink?
You tell me.
It was an accident.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.
What happened, Nick?
I didn't.
How exactly did you hear?
You're not easy to figure.
Jack Daniel's okay?
What did you pay Nilsen?
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
Aren't you going to thank me?
Why does he do it?
When did you write it?
How's your new book?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
Did you think it was so special?
What did you think?
How about Roxy?
How's your shoulder?
Are you kidding?
You shouldn't play this game.
You're in over your head.
I should have known.
It's OK.  It's OK.
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
No.
You won't believe me.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.
Do you believe me?
What did he say?
Can I talk to you a minute?
You like to hang out with murderers or what?
I just thought I'd surprise you.
How'd you get in here?
I have to do some research tomorrow.
I finished my book.
What do you want, Nick?
What do we do now, Nick?
I hate rugrats.
I'm John Corrigan.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
How did he die?
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
You have the right to an attorney.
You workin' on another book?
It teaches you to lie.
The answer is no.
What kind of drugs?
In the beginning.
He was walking home from work.
Was she ever a suspect?
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Ain't that cute?
How'd it go, son?
What you doin', son?
Was she ever suspect?
What's goin' down, son?
No, sir.
She knows where I live and breathe.
You think I --
I don't think it's funny.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
You... fucked her!
You feeling better?
I'm not afraid of her.
It doesn't make sense.
You all right, pop?
Catherine says you don't like her.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
Where the hell you goin'?
Maybe the maid did it.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
You look like dogshit.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
Homicide.
Were you with him last night?
What was the motive?
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.
Keep your three o'clock.
Are you kidding me?
I love it.
So what do we do -- nothing?
You sure?
Now what?
Fuck you, Phil.
Gus -- go over to Berkeley.
I.
Tell me again.
You knew her, didn't you?
She's a suspect.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
Why do you think he's dead?
Who are you?
How old was she when this happened?
Anderson.
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
He died -- about five or six years ago.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat.
Hey  it's the big A.M..
Is this finished yet?
What do you think?
Naa..
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
You wanna buy some ignorant art?
Andy, man, thanks for coming.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone.
Cool.
Let's leave this town and go someplace.
Ouch..
What's with the wigs?
Piss painting?
That was my favorite part!
Bruno called.
Who is it?
Is Jean Michel here?
These are great.
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
No.
When?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
Jean, your parents are here.
Chill, man!
Who did this?  Who did this?
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
MOTHAFUCKAH!
You shouldn't have put it in the show.
Do you think I could borrow your limousine?
B.
I hear your show was sold out already.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Bruno spoke to me already.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
A primate?
Would you like to see the wine list?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
Paint it out.
It's Andy again.
You want me to put it here?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Blue? Where?
Hey  Willie Mays.
Who's that?
"She loves me.
I knew I left these somewhere.
You got a date already?
Come on, Jean.
You're shattering all my myths.
Whatever.
Famous people are usually pretty stupid.
What're you doing? You're doing something.
Check you later, man.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
We got beat.
You gonna carry that around all night?
What's the rush, John Henry?
I don't really have any problems.
That's not how I meant it.
She's good.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
Have you been camping?
You do! You definitely do.
I thought you hated this place?
Wanna go get some breakfast?
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!
... I'll buy you some new ones.
Do you know what he's saying?
... What's the matter?
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
It looks done.
... babies.
Hi.
So are you really friends with Andy?
So.
Wow.
That is amazing. What year is it?
Baby, I think about you a lot.
You don't have to be sorry.
Is that the best quality you have?
I really... admire you.
What's your name, man?
Hi.
See you later.
How can I ever thank you?
Come on.
That's a beautiful name. French?
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
You see? You have someone to live for.
What? What do you want?
You heard of Albert Milo.
Uh huhh... Band practice?
So keep painting.
That one's for you.
You fucking little whore!
Hey, Rene.
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
'Phillips head,' right?
You don't have any!!!
Jean?
OK! Goodbye!
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.

I guess this mean we won.
Where's the fire?
How could you?  I'm a woman...
A "he-man"?
I can't sleep either, lately.
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
A kiss under the misteltoe.
First you're gonna shut up.
Admiring your handiwork?
We've met.
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
Pouring myself into my work.
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
The news these days .
You're not coming to that, are you?
You almost sound enthusiastic.
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
Well?
A kiss under the mistletoe.
... What do we do?
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
What happened?
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
Let's make a deal.
Selina!
I'll warm ya!
Are you perchance a registered voter?
Y'mean frame him?
Thanks.
He napalmed my arm.
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
Me, domesticated?

Ten, nine...
Actually this is all just a bad dream.
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir?
Don't look, Oswald.

It's our secret.
Okay, go ahead.
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
Morning, Max.
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
Joanna and I were in love in London.
You certainly will not.
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
Find my brother Wilfred.
Uncle Alfred?
He's over-eager, impulsive.
I must have dozed off.
You have?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr.
Is there something wrong, sir?
But I can't can I?
I am as well as can be expected.
I love you, old man.
It's good to see you.
Advanced botany.
What is it?
Alfred, are you...?
I'm on break from-
Please be looking for me.
Al's main squeeze.
I could have made it, you know.
This is to replace the bike I lost.
I started racing after my parents died.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.
Alpha.
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
This is easy.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
You were a great scientist once.
Mr.
You're loosing your cool
Go on, kill me too.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
I was just hanging around.
Watch the first step.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
You don't have two million.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
She's definitely part of this.
How did you...?
She's still alive.
No beauty...
Remember the victim at the airport.
We gotta get those locks changed.
No sign of the snowman.
If we could relay the sunlight-
Winded, old timer?
They're overly protective.
Forget the stars.
No!?
And?
You're not even listening to me.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind.
Who's Ivy?
Dr.
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
That's gotta hurt.
What happened to his wife?
He needs extreme cold to survive.
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
Of course.
He's dying.
McGregor's Syndrome.
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
One question.
Let me guess, Plant Girl?
Impressive
I love that belt.
No gun.  How disarming.
My reserves are exhausted.
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
You will rescue my wife
Make yourself right at home.
Their bones will turn to ice.
Yes.
Prepare for a bitter harvest.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
I'm glad you came.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
What do we have here?
Join you?
Dr. Isley?
The dreams again, sir?
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
Scholarly research?
Gee, I'm not sure.
It's happening again.
Sorry to bother you, sir.
Too much wealth.
Maybe they're right.
Why do I keep doing this?
How are you feeling, young man?
I'm Batman?
Master, Bruce?
All the answers are numbers.
Letters in the alphabet.
What now sir?
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
Up here, Al.
...dual personalities.
He's home. I sent the signal.
Now black rubber.
We all wear masks.
I haven't had much luck with women...
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Death.
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Mr...?
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.
So glad you could come.
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
My opinion.
It's a stretch but I'll manage.
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
Like normal folks.
That kid is amazing.
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday.
A lot of what happened is jagged.
Find anything interesting?
Why do you do that?
In a sense we are all two people.
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
Your memories are repressed.
My parents are laid out in the library.
Okay. I'm outta here.
Where will you go?
I need to be part of this.
Back off, man.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
You can't-.
Exactly.
Chase?
Edward...
Who is The Batman, Edward?
I really do apologize, Mr.
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?
Hell.
I'll show you it works.
Yo.
_We_ sure are.
...or death.
That floor has got to be very hard.
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
How'd you find us?
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!
Holy shit.
No.  Wait...
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
Sure, E = MC squared.
Not until you do that thing I like.
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
Why do we need you?
Go ahead. You can say it.
We want to dust him.
A-14.
B-12.
A hit.
How high up would you say that is?
Yes?
Excuse me, sir.
It's all right, Alfred.
Where's the boy?
How long's it been, Alfred?
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
GET IN THE CAR!!
Look! Police!
What about the girl?
Can't we --
How much do you weigh?
...Not even a 'thank you'?
I'll have to ask you for that film.
Please.
The Joker is a murderer.
Thank you, Vicki.
... How long have I been out?
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
How'd you find this place?
They don't come down here.
What is that?
They've got it all wrong.
I just can't absorb it all.
Is this what you wanted?
"This is Miss Vale.
That's how it is, chum.
Do you want a drink?
Do you sail?
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.
There's terror everywhere.
But it's not fair.
I don't sing very well.
All street mimes should be executed.
I know it's late.
Vicki?
So we just pretend none of this ever happened.
Money makes money, Vicki.
It's like the last time.
Oh, Bruce.
"It worked for Van Gogh.
Keep her on the line!
I'm sorry, she hung up.
Got it!
I don't know why I'm doing this.
We got 'em!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
Boss! Jesus! They've --
MOVE! Can't you do something??
I missed you, Lieutenant.
I'm on top of it.
I answer to Grissom, punk.
Got it all figured, huh?
Let's beat it, man.
There was no blood, man.
My brother's a priest, man.
Okay, a break-in.
I understand.
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
It's not the girl, Jack.
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
I don't like taking orders from Grissom.
Joker here. Can we talk?
All right, then.
... Thank you.
And you want a --
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
... Why the mask?
You SCUM!
I'll see you burn.
How'd you know it was me?
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
No.
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.
Where does one man get all this junk?
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Peanuts?
Plain or roasted?
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
Yep.
You are on drugs.
Alexander... I know you.
The guy's bats all right.
Vicki.
Couldn't turn down the job, huh?
LOOK!
HOLY SHIT!!
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Do we know anything about him?
It's the last thing we need.
Scottish.
It isn't working any more, David.
Jesus.
Go ahead.
There were three strawberries.
Liar.
Ali?  What's wrong?
Shut up, Kevin.
Okay.

He's not too bad.
Two dollars please.
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Excuse me.
Goodnight Annie.
Big day today, huh? 78
David.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
Seems to be a problem with the door.
Oh Jesus.
Oh yes.
It wasn't a dream, was it.
It's very good Bernie.
I was hoping DU.
And howls Alison?
Look, I've left Bean on his own.
Great day.
Everything okay, David?
We'll be able to start this afternoon.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.
This is Elmer, our longest serving...
Okay, that'll do.
Say that again, son.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
Ah, David.
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
No!
Thank you David.
Brilliant, huh?
I think you're wrong, David.
Well, congratulations.
David, David, David ...
Of course.
Maybe two cars.
Welsh again.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
Bye, Dad.
You've known me five years Elmer.
You arrange those flowers yourself?
He was incredible.
Is Jenny gonna be okay?
... in the distant future.
Doctor Jacobson?
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
Interesting suit.
Shut up, Kevin.
I wish I could use that at school.
You know, Mr.
Come on Sting!
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score.

Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
What a dork. Huh huh.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Whoa, check it out Beavis.

Damn, huh huh.
So, like, where is she?
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
That was boring. Huh huh.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
That's not that much.
Uh... Is this the right bus?
Huh huh huh.
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.

You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.

They look like a couple of kids chief.
You see what I see, Bork?
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ!
Cavity search...?
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.

She's ready.
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
Oh no.
Wave at the lion.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
You'd better sit down, hon.
Anything happen while I was away?
Handbook for the recently diseased.
I don't think we survived the crash.
I don't like situations like this.
Cabin fever, hon?
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
She can't see you, right?
Oh, honey, we may need that.
Barbara, honey!
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
That little girl saw us.
There's nothing we can do.
My God, we're back where we started.
That guy is in our cemetery.
God, this is so corny.
I feel really stupid.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Here's something.
Go ahead... third time's a charm.
What happened?
Has anything been simple so far?
I guess we open it.
She's only fourteen...
Honey.  Let's go.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
And your sushi was remarkable.
Maybe they'll leave now.
<u>Adam</u>!
You know, I've been thinking.
We've been given a gift here, honey.
What...?
What time is it?
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.
Aren't you scared?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
Nobody else can.
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
<u>You</u> did this?
We weren't there.
What is going on?
Did you get the paint?
We studied all day yesterday.
So can I?
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Wait for who?
Aren't you dead?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
Are you available?
Hell is other people.
I heard.
Handbook?  When...?
Yes... or no?
All right.  Who are you?
Just get some people out of our house.
Folks, be reasonable here.
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
I'd nearly given up on you.
We're very unhappy.
-- Like you used to be?
No.
If.
No, you don't!
The whorehouse was my idea.
What about Betelgeuse?
Tell the truth.
We can't.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
How'd you do on the science test?
Hi, Barb!
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Three syllables.
I don't know what that signal means.
Beetle!
Breakfast beetle?
I am <u>not</u>!
God, you're anatomically correct!
So... You're ready for me now?
W... What is it?
Yes, of course you are.
Otho?
It's <u>Otho</u>!
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.
What do you think, honey?
Lydia, relax.
Where is your mother?
I was just trying to open the door.
Skeleton keys never work.
What?
Dad.  Do you believe me?
The attic room is locked --
Answer your mother.
Now, let's get back to business.
They're... not here anymore.
Not <u>a building</u>!
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
I don't care from guilt.
Are they suffering?
<u>You jerks</u>!
All right, you dead people!
What's wrong?
Okay?
What do you think?
Blue-green!
<u>Oh my God</u>!
Is there much more of this torture?
'I' will tell you what is boring.
You don't have a key?
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
Are they still here, Otho?
What's happening to them?
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.
Is this the key to the attic?
Hellooo!  How's school?
It's bad luck.
Otho, that's terrible.
They don't want to come down.
All presences have a home space.
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
Wait a minute!
Their wedding clothes.
<u>Adam</u>!
You were wrong, it did hurt.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
... And please call me Robert.
Chauncey, there you are.
... Were you going somewhere?
I would like to walk today.
... He's gone, Chauncey.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
I know exactly what you mean.
... No, of course you don't.
No more, Robert... No more needles...
... He walked off...
... Do you think we should look for him?
Do you know Raphael?
I understand.
I hope you're comfortable.
Would you care for a drink?
I would like to watch television.
May I ask your name?
Did you lose something?
Oh, I know exactly what you mean.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey!
What is that?
Chauncey...
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
Yes.
Chauncey, where have you been?
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Hello, Mr.
I see.
Can you see well?
Do you need a doctor?
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
I feel very good in here.
No, thank you.
That's good, Mr.
Do we have a garden?
A gardener!
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
No, Ben.
Certainly, Ben.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
Mr.
... Then you really are a gardener?
What about money?
Some pictures...?
How about taxes, Mr.
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr.
Good day, Mr. Chance.
Can you walk?
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
Please, sir.
... My suitcase.
Does it have a television?
How long do we stay in here?
... That is a very small room.
... Hmmm... Elevator.
... Evening, Chance.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
Good morning, Louise.
Dammit, Boy!
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Mr.
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
Have you served in the Army?
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
Mr.
No, Thomas.
Good morning, Mr. President.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. It has.
... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact.
Oh.
... Ben, really...
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
Thank you, Greta.
Eve, child!
And look who you brought with!
Come on, Eve.
... How are the kids getting along?
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
I can certainly understand that...
... What do you make of all this?
It's that gardener!
... Business, bullshit!
Yes? What have you found?
This is not what I requested.
... So what does all that add up to?
Ben!
John!
I'll get right to the point, Larry.
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Malkovich.
Thank you.
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
Oh, thank you!
Morning.
Is the trial date set?
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Why, Craig. why?
Isn't that cute?
Yeah, just an idea I had.
Hi.
Did you eat?
Don't be ridiculous.
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
I have to go back.
I have to go back, Craig.
Lotte!
Why aren't you at work?
How was it?
So how was it? What was he doing?
What are you doing?
What about Maxine?
You were him last night, weren't you?
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
I'm your Goddamn wife.
Tell her you need to see her.
Once this was a relationship based on love.
My God!
Maxine...
Holy shit, yes!
Mr.
So how was it?
Welcome to LesterCorp.

Moving story.

I like you.
That's the usual?
Im not a homosexual.
No, wait!
So, tell me about yourself.
Hi.
This is important!
There's a tiny door in that empty office.
Okay.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive.
This is amazing!
You're late.
You're glowing again.
Lotte, this is so good...
Lotte? Is that you?
Let him try.
But I gotta go now.
Hello, Don.
So that's the story of 7 1/2.
Hi.
I'll be with you always, my friends.
No.
Boy, this is a toughie.
Have a seat.
How'd it go?
I missed you.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Yes, my dear?
Do you dream often?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before.
Anybody else?
I'm getting divorced.
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
No! Don't harm the vessel!
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
And the funny thing is.
Ah.
Yes?
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
J.
We have to meet.
Maxine!
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
She's not available.
How do we do that?
Yeah?
Can I get you a drink?
Thanks so much for coming over.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
Something was making me talk.
Darling!
Come on in.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
You still there, sweets?
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
Stay in him forever?
Shut up!

Bad dream, darling?
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Yeah what?!
Good-bye, Maxine.

You don't want to go there.
Why do you hate us so much?
You're hurting me.
It means "bloodbrother."
How does it look?
What do you want me to do?
How do you feel?
You came back for me.
I agree.
What do you think?
He's right.
Where were you, Whistler?
I am worrying.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
Your security's for shit, kid.
What's your problem, Whistler?
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
And so will we.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
Put it back in park, Blade.
You want me to hunt them for you.
And why is that?
You got something in mind, Blade?
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
So you're going to do this?
What's going on?
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
So that's down and dirty.
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
Oh yeah?
What the fuck you doing?
His name is Jared Nomak.
We're locked in.
Yes?
An inevitability, I suppose.
You worry too much, Stevens.
Tell me something, Skid --
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
The hell are you fiddling with there?
Pretty.
What about you?  You're not coming?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
Whistler!
She's been bitten.
I had to increase the dose.
Stupidity.
Get in. Youre leaving.
What took you so long?
Going somewhere?
Don't try to talk --
Whistler, I --
Beautiful day, isn't it?
The pause that refreshes --  Care for some?
You're not going anywhere.
No longer.
Who dies first?
You're too human, Blade.
Is something wrong, my friend?
Hold out your hands.
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
You shouldn't be here.
-- he's a vampire.
Why?
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
I can go to the police.
How did you know?
But he's a policeman --
What are you doing?!
What are you looking at?
Looks like we hit pay-dirt.
What is this place?
You're hurt --
What am I injecting you with?
It's dark in here.
Just get out of here.
Is he sick?
You care about him, don't you?
Any progress?
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
Is it bad?
It won't work on you.
Get out of here --
-- tearing me -- apart.
How's it going, Kam?
But you -- died --
Please --
How could you be a part of this?
This isn't human blood.
Curtis, it's three in the morning.
Five minutes, not a second more.
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
That's weird --
Blade.
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity.
I see.
The shadows suit us, Frost.
How do you like that? Right on time.
How many of you are there?
LaMagra isn't a physical being.
There's no need for any of this.
You're a monster.
Blade --
I was wrong about you, Blade.
What -- ?
Who are you people?
So what do you use, then?
Consider it a parting gift.
We keep in radio contact.
Whistler!
Blade's unique, you know.
Why do you hunt them?
How did you escape?
On me, yes.
What happened to the power?
--and if she ever did--
--or incredibly fucking naive.
'Give you a hand.
What, are you alright?
Not that I can see.
No.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch?
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
Please!
Domini?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
--stop it!
Why?
No!
Shit?
'Thought those all got stolen.
Why are we here?
What's she look like?
--how old?
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
Oak?
Yeah, so?
This is funny?
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
Druid Hill Park.
Looks like business is booming.
--the witch kills children--
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
Cheery little place.
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
So says her website.
Jesus.
--<u>myth</u>--
No.
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents.
What?
Baby names?
--or someone--
This is a goddamn disaster.
I think we get the gist.
--now c'mon!
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
What can I get you?
Nothing. I dunno--
Was that you laughing?
I want to see something!
Are you marked like this??
--like you hurt the baby--
Oh, Jesus, no--
Absolutely.
You want a hand?
Beer and weed is what I've got.
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
<u>One</u> set.
How'd you know they were--
I don't think it was them.
This is a little nuts.
Does it hurt?
There, what? I didn't see anything.
Okay, a blur.
Can't you like just divine it?
So lemme see it.
The witch?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
I don't believe this.
Nice tent.
What movies?
What I never could figure about the movie?
We should be so lucky.
What're you, crazy??
--yeah, a hand or something--
Me, too.
What about night?
Used to be a meat-packing plant.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Mi casa y su casa!
English.
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
Where <u>is</u> it?
Where's Domini?
Fire escape??
Same trees.
Cotter?
Boy Kurth.
Where?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
It's <u>freezing</u>.
What the fuck--??
Be it still alive, James?
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
Nobody's going anywhere--
That's a "j."
Who?
Hold this.
--Cotter--
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Cotter?
What're you doing?
What?
Okay, but--
How're the cameras doing?
--and none of 'em were mine!
Cotter, I think she's right.
403 41st Street, kids: home.
Let's get inside.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
Running a junk yard.
What--
--whatever you want, no problem--
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Just hold on!
Just let it go, I've got you!
What?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
What is all this shit?
She got <u>paid</u>.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Oooh. Oooh.
Ripped?
That's almost a year's worth of work!
Pointless.
What?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Women miscarry all the--
What's that?
What'd you see?
For a blur?
Cotter'll kill you.
Dad...?
Are you alright?
Jesus.
What?
You gonna be alright?
What're you afraid's going to happen?
--bullshit--
Finally got her back to sleep.
There's explanations.
What?
Spare me.
Domini's the only logical explanation.
I can't do it!
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
I should check on Anna.
No.
"It's why the witch kills children."
What the fuck's going on here?
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
....Ma'am?
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
Thanks, Meurice.
Abby. What's the matter?
Jesus, I got a hangover.
...For you I answer the door.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty.
...Ray?
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
...Drive me to a motel?
Who was it?
Well... the couch would be all right...
I could've sworn I heard something.
I knew it.
...Well I'll be damned.
Uh-huh.
Nothing.
Hello?
...You all right?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...Ray?
...What?
Why didn't you get into bed?
...You called me this morning.

Well... what happened?
...Anyway, we got some time now.
...That's what's important.
...Who?
...What's going on with you two?
...Where is everything?
...You leaving?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...So?
You won't have to.
So how long have you know Meurice?
...So what're you doing tonight?
It'll pass.
He needs a room, Dusty.
I reckon I can hear him.
Sure don't.
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
...I don't know.
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
...You know that car?
...What was that back there?
What "what"?
Then what'd you come here for?
What did you take these for?
...Just doin' my job.
Now that don't make much sense.
...Anything else?
...That's the test, ain't it?
If the pay's right I'll do it.
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that.
You want me to kill 'em.
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
...There's a big--
Yeah. Is it...
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Dead, huh?
...What did you do with the bodies?
Something I got to ask you, Marty.
...I just made a call about that.
...it's too damn risky.
...Count it if you want.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
What's this?
Deuce in the corner needs help.
What's this?
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
Howdy stranger.
Is Marty here?
Got a problem, Meurice?
...Why?
...and Abby.
Where was I?

Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.
I'm so glad you two could make it.

Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.

You can't sell this to your friends.

Half a million for you.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
Christ almighty, George.
I want my kid out of protective custody.
George?
Oh, come on, George.
What do you got there, Diego?
I never believed you were a murderer.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
What type of planes do you have?
Diego Delgado, please?
Good to see you, Diego.
Fifteen kilos.
Please, continue.
What's the matter, George?
This is only part of the business, George.
George.
Thirty-six hours.
George, good to see you, my brother.
Three million.  I counted it twice.

Three years.
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
Estoy bien, okay?
Derek Foreal.

He's in tachycardia.
Well, you know.  It's um...

There's something out there for me, Dad.
What are you going to do?
There's something out there for me, Dad.

Hi.
She's angry.
Give this to Mom, will you?
Tell Mom, you know...
And that FBI agent, Trout?

Mirtha, how are you doing?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart.

What are you doing here?
Let me ask you something.
California?
Bye, Dad.
I'm sorry, baby.
I fucked up.
But I have a visitor.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
It's a four-man operation.
You saved my life, Dulli.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
For instance, something like this?
Good to see you, Jorge.
Well, I'll tell you.
Right on.
Yeah?
It's not enough.
So?
Okay.
Not that far, only halfway.
Holy shit, Dulli!
Are we good?
Nice weed, huh?
No shit, Kevin?
Smith.  Hampshire....
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine.
What's the matter, George?
This is bullshit, George.
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
Look around.
Excuse me, colonel.
Go ahead!
You afraid of these ...?
How much are they paying you?
With an unloaded pistol?
Let's suppose you were a spy.
But I haven't shot him.
And how many are we?
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
Go away!
Can you read?
Read it.
Where's Kader?
Be careful now.
It's good nobody is following us ...
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
It's clear.
No ...
Good evening ... Can we pass?
Where were we?
Good, thank you, Corbiere.
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thbes?
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head.
Why?
What is she saying?
Who is speaking?
Okay.
Are you ready, colonel?
How you doin' Mister D?
I've been waiting for you to get back.
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.
Here it is!
Take some time off.
You did a good job, Charlie.
So she knew about his heart?
I think I'm going to make your day.
Yeah.
About three hours.
Marsh wasn't alone.
What are you saying, Henry?
What can we prove?
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Objection sustained.
No questions.
Objection, Your Honor.
That's it.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
Can you?
C'mon -- think about it.
She's innocent.
Objection, Your Honor.
I've got work to do.
What's happening to you, Frank?
That's ridiculous.
Objection.
Objection!
Objection!
Can I go?
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.
Her name?
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
Is it Marsh?
Who found him?
What happened next?
Why did she say she was leaving?
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
Yes.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
What kind of information?
Did you suggest any?
You'll be sorry?
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
Don't you see what she's doing?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
October twenty-seventh.
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
I heard him say it.
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
What did he say?
What happened next?
I worked for Mr.
How do you know that?
Yes -- he mentioned it.
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
Who told you that?
Yes.
I'm a practical woman Mr.
I've tried it.
I've been to a few -- yes.
Yes.
You take what people say and make it ugly.
What do you have in your purse?
I'm gonna go to jail.
Hi, Joe.
Yes.
Are you going to represent me?
Do you think I did it?
He'll file.
Frank!
How'd you meet Marsh?
-- And then?
Can we get out of here?
This is your house.
Why not?
What do you think?
Nothing.
Hello?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
Yes -- it would be nice.
You lied to me!
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
Alone?
You were brilliant today.
Can I see you later?
Something wrong?
Sugar or honey?
Rebecca -- take these off.
What are you going you doing?
What's that for?
You killed him -- didn't you?
I'm dropping the case.
Hello?
You killed him.
I've been thinking about that.
She's right, Paley.
No -- he's lying.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man.
Alright, I'll talk to her
What are they saying?
I love you.
Michael -- get off the phone.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
But Your Honor--
Objection.
The witness will answer the question.
You're on vacation, remember?
Can't it wait?
Hello?
I swear -- the both of you.
She sounds like quite a woman.
Humped
Is that alright, Frank?
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
Sharon, it's late.
Working.
This isn't a courtroom.
I know.
You wouldn't like what you'd see.
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
Albert's got the stomach flu.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
Yes.
Did Marsh use it?
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
I don't mind waiting.
Eeeww!
How bizarre!
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
He dropped them off at Betty's mom.
I thought everything WAS arranged.
Yeah.
What's he saying now?
My Lord.
I can't believe she's making jokes.
Grateful!?
What are you doing?
He's getting her drunk.
Bar across the street.
I used to love this place.
Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?
See.
She's changed.
Oh, this heat!
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
What do you know about "the changes"?
Madge?
Madge.

Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
Roseman Bridge?
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
Pretty country.

So, how long you've been living here?
This won't take long.
This time of year.
Oh there you are.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they?
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Looking for something in particular?
Oh, that's nice.
Lemon?
Mind if I smoke?
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
Where are you staying while you're here?
Everything does.
He's very... clean.
Feeling better?
I better go.
Would you like to stay for dinner?
Help cook?
What?
You ought to write these stories down.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
And did you?
I'm sorry. That was...
My God.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
Smells like dirt.
You really don't need anyone?
My mistake. I apologize.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Francesca?
It's Robert.
Oh.

I'm positive.
Want anything special for dinner?
Franny?
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Okay.
Uh.
Oh my God...!
Think for a second.
About an hour ago.
When did she decide this?
It clearly states in the will --
Don't feed that dog.
Outta my way, boy.
We can't go back there.
Your father was his best friend.
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
Is it true?
Hey, kid.
Bones!
Are you nuts?
You didn't hear that?
'S up?
Ugh.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.
You think that's really him?
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Damn.
You want us to move in here?
You soundin' like the old man now.
Tia ain't a chick.
Shit.
No.
Where's the others?
Yeah, we can.
You sure got a way with women, bro.
Where's the gangsta of love?
You ain't going down there.
We can climb out.
Is this Hell?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.
That's what?
Looking to score?
You got a nice crib here.
What else?  Money.
I ain't interested.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early.
Left hand's the past.
No?
Jimmy, you've got --
Where are we, baby?
'Sup Jimmy B.

Everybody just be cool.
Sorry, my brother.

Aren't you going to join us?
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.

It's alright, baby.
You got his hands.
He'll kill them.
We'll have to sneak in.
Told you so.

Are they on the radio?
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Cinn?
She doesn't want me here.
I can't.  Not yet.
I'm here.
Here, find my hand.
We gotta jump!
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
You got the cash?
Let me see it.
Don't worry.
Where are we going?
What are we doing down here?
Listen to me, boy.
Did you do it?

"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Not really to live, just to play.
You look mighty familiar to me.
You sure we oughta save him?
It's not safe down there.
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
There wasn't any draft.
Boy, put that thing down.
Shit!
Whoa, whoa.
You shouldn't have hit me.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
That's right, I know.
How the fuck can I open it?
The next one blows off your dick.
We know how this was done, eh?
Caesar?  What is this?
Caesar!
No, Gino!
Sit down, Gino!
We're family, Caesar.
I didn't expect --
Oh, shit ...
She's doing the work herself.
So, you just got out?
Not bad.  What for?
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Caesar, I'm serious.
Caesar, what happened?
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
Fuck!
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
They were early.
You mean they weren't up here?
What?
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
I hate that little fuck!
Got to think this through ...

He didn't see you, did he?
You can't leave.
Tell them!  Tell them!
...  maybe three hours.
Fuck.
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
It's not here, Caesar.
What are you doing?
Where is the money?
Violet!
Stupid cunt!
What did she do to you?
I saved you.
Saved me?
What?
Holy shit, I don't believe it!
We were in a car accident --
I want what's mine, half the money.
Now that's teamwork.
Caesar, don't.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
Fuck, this happened before.
Not on duty, sorry.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
You're helping Rajeev?
How many'd you do?
Good.
Now, where the fuck is my money?
You can't kill me yet.
Yeah?
Yeah, Mick.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Cease, can I ask you something?
Is that the money?
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
You got the key?
Call me as soon as you get him.
Hello?
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
See?  We're for real.
This is a beautiful place.
Hi.
Who?
So this is temporary for you?
I guessed you were straight black.
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
Truck.
Do you know him?
I should be going.
Oh no.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Thank you so much.
Okay, one drink.
You seem uncomfortable.
Curious, maybe.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Isn't it obvious?
I had to see you.
...  I needed that.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
The redistribution of wealth.
What's wrong?
Yes there is.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
Shelly was skimming from the business.
Caesar lives for these moments.
I want out.
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
These people are serious, Violet.
You said he washed the money?
And where is it now?
It's in a case, on his desk.
Yes.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Gino Marzzone.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
What time did you say they would be there?
Where will you be?
What if he sees you?
I'm just asking, what if?
There is no going back.
He'll have to run.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
It's me.
He totally freaked.
Oh, thank God.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Hey.
Hey, Caesar!
No, Johnnie.
Done.  We go now.
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
Johnnie, what did I say?
You shouldn't have to see this.
Oh, God.
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
I will never understand it, Mickey.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.
She's a gypsy.

I need a ride.
Jesus...
So what's in Paris?
I said ten thousand.
Look, I want a ride to Paris.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.
I don't know.
I needed a break.
You ever think maybe you have a family?
Slow down.
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
Where?
So this is it, right?
I should go.
Okay, so...
This is like a real apartment.
This is your office?

And that's the best angle of the courtyard?

Perhaps the machine's on the blink!
What a relief!
It's your mother isn't it?

There we go.
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
You'd never get away with it.

Is there any chance?
I wouldn't do that.
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
You shouldn't smoke.
Yes?
He's better, isn't he?
Be tough to get a taxi here.
He wants to pull that tube out.
That's how it's done.
My father was a great man, you know.
Excuse me.

Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
What did I do to you?
How <u>you</u> doing?
Shut up a second...
Don't name them.
Yes.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I'm in a pissy mood.
Wait.
I don't like being handled.
No.
No.  No.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Everybody has one like that.
What did they do with you?
You packing up tonight?
Yes.
This story they won't cover.
You know what I...
Hi.
He excels at gratitude.
It's nice to see you.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
Hi.
Where's where I asked him about being scared?
He must have been great-looking, right?
Okay.  Let's do me.
Nine seconds.
I didn't sleep.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
I write for you sometimes.
What happened?
Me again.
Well, whatever you think.
Jesus, Jane.
Aaah --  -- ello.
Tom...why don't I meet you there?
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
How'd it go?
Don't go.
What?
I think you're the Devil.
Don't say anything about anything.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Let's go...
You are now required to sit here with me.
So who's the guy?
I like it!
Ready.
Okay.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.
That's it.  I resign as of now.
Oh, I was just writing you a note.
Anyway.
Do it then.
Okay.
It's what he did.
Just a few questions?
We came from Washington.
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
Goodbye, Paul.
Just when do you start, telling people?
Jane?
But thanks.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
What did he say?
It's Aaron.
What are you dressed up for?
They canned me.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.
Play back the last line...
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
I really have to go.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Is everything all right?
Good.
Ernie, they're calling from work.
What?
How horrible.
Bye, sweetie.
...am starting to get jealous.
I got my report card.
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.
I had no idea she was this good.
Hi.
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
If we could just eat first.
I was doing sports at the station.
Listen to me.
Whoa, this was a mistake.
They said it would be okay if...
I'm sorry if I was in the way.
I can't help you, sorry.
Hi.
So he was indicted?
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
I've got another story.
You okay?
Nervous?
We're going to George.
You're an amazing woman.
Jane?
I didn't think you'd make it.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
So you like me, huh?
So what did you think?
It's incredible who's here.
You okay?
Why can't I let go of this woman?
At least kiss me when you do that.
I forgot all about Aaron.
What happened?
Hi.  It's me.
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
Hello?
I feel terrible about what happened.
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.
Then give me a minute...
Why?
I felt funny about it afterwards.
I don't wan to discuss work.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
Take it easy.
Well, why not?
What a great surprise.
This is very awkward.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Where's the bathroom?
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.
That's enough.  That's enough.
Don't you work here?
Would you like to do me?
That's not true I am a sculptor!
What are you doing here?
Well I'm touched.
Tonight.
It's kind of dark -
I'm almost ready -
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Not even a little bit?
A girl with a body like mine?
Walter can I ask you something?
It's just an innocent question.
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
Alright we're clear.
What the hell's going on?
See you later -
You really like it?
Great!  What is it?
It's called spontaneity, Leonard.
Look at the size of it!
Like it?
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Hi Walter.
What's up, Walter?
Is it murdered man?
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
More champagne, your majesty?
Where where...
May I please have another little kiss?
Did you hear what he said?
It's true, isn't it?
I know what it is to be ignored.
I mean, you look so pretty.
Goodbye.
Nice night out...
I like you very much, Walter.
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.
But you gotta love me!
Now calm down Walter!
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Would you really like to?
Walter...there's...
Walter...stay away from me!
That's word for word.
Here you go, enjoy.
Put it in the middle of the room!
Walter...I can't believe it.
Hi Walter...
Maybe so...
You've arrived.
Are you trying to be funny?
Murdered...man?...
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
What's the matter with you?
No.
It will take years to make that many statues.
Would you pose for me for free?
It's our road kill series.
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
I wonder what his deal is.
There's that weird dude again.
Man look at that get up !
Man this is heavy!
What did he say?
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Walter, what are you doing?
Where'd ya buy that?
You...made that?
Dead Cat!
Alright, I'll tell you what.
People seem to like my cat.
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis?
Go home.
H-have a seat?
Hiya Carla.
You know what that proves?
Well...why murdered man?
It's hot in here...
A show?!  Like this Sunday?

You better hold off on the bubbly.
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
What do you have in the box?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Walter.
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.
I want that cat.
How ya doin'?
Hello, Walter.
I also saw the girl give you this.
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
Police officer.
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?
I- don't know what you're talking about!
You're gonna shoot me!
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
Are you done with these?
I saw your...cat.
Maxwell.
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
Hi.
After that we go no more!
I won't say good luck, Walter.
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?
I get it Walter.  I get it.
Hello Mayolia.
With Dead Cat.
It's like...you've turned on.
Well, I'll go home with you.
I don't think so Mayolia.
I want you to have it.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Good night Walter...
What's all the noise in here!
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
I don't think this is gold.
What's wrong with you!?!
You reckless imbecile.
I look horrible.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Well, um... litter?
Whoa!
Nice to feel needed.
Nice game.
Man has a complex.
Don't grab me, okay?
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
Buffy, this is crazy.

Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Rich bitches.

Did you see a girl come by here?
Excellent.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Dying.

Do you know what time it is?
Buffy, honey?

What show is this?
Oh, wow.
What'd you dream about?
Hey there.

Hey, baby, how ya doing?
I can't get sick.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
So that's your tutor, huh?
Buffy, what are you doing here?
I don't understand.
Ah, my fool is dead.
You're even weaker than the others.
This?
I am a God!  A God!
Will you guys shut up, please?
Yeah, we're drunk.
Hi.
How are you doing?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot?
You had a car full of stuff.
Hey, jeez are you okay?
Things are kind of confusing.
I'm kinda beat.
Hey, Buffy...
I didn't expect to see you.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
I been working on some stuff for you.
I'm going to the dance.
Leave me alone.
I crashed your party.
I'm going out the front.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Are you okay?
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Bugs.
Can't.
Guys, what's the sitch?
What are we doing?
Beverly Center.
Totally stale.
Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
You were supposed to be here at three.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
I'm glad you guys are here.
God, where the hell did you come from?
What?
Just stay away from me, okay?
Everybody does.
I was a slave.
How do you know all this?
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Ow.
Wait a minute.
Where's the other one?
Go to school tomorrow.
Meet me at this address after school.
They can't come in, right?
What, um...  What do we do?
Not a pressing issue.
Who we gonna beat?
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?
It was necessary.
Oh.  Sorry.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
All right.
What!?!
He was slow.
Nice conversationalist!
Five?
I want to die.
Interesting.
There isn't time.
Wait!
Mr.
No THX.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
Come one, that was so weird.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
That is so cool.
I don't get it.
You guys blow.
Don't worry, Jennifer.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
Pike.
Hi, guys.
I haven't seen him tonight.
What... are you?
No, wait.
I can't!
The mark of the Coven.
Bessel!  What are you doing here?
Listen, you little worm.
Write that down.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Buffy?
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
I can't believe they still ate it.
I got all the plastic stuff.
And Spring Fling.
She was even crazier after that.
Omniplex?
What happened?
I never thought of that.
Buffy!
Cool!
The don't.
They'll kill us!
Oh, God.
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
The homelesses?
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Oh, yeah!
Smell of booze much.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
I really was way way too too.
What are you talking about?
Oh, thank you very much.
So, we're stupid now?
And the January Semi-formal --
Ah, you'll be coming back.
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
Yeah maybe you're right.
Mmm, hmmm.
God I'm tired.
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
The right nostril.  Good.
You're patronizing me!
How was that?
How ya like that?
I can't keep up with you.
Death is like spring training?
I'm yours.
That's my leg.
Fundamentals?
No!  You're playing with my mind!
Nuke!
We lost.
I'd like you to meet my father.
It's Skip, for you.
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
Well I guess this is it.
Neither will I.
You should be at the game.
Five hours.
I'm Crash Davis.
She's dancing with me.
These are the ground rules.
See my hips?
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.
Damn.
Don't tell anybody.
Damn.
Your place or mine?
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
Crash...I want you.
You're gorgeous, God damn it!
Who are you?  Do you have a job?
God damn you--what is happening?
Why baseball?
I got released.
What happened?
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
He's a good student.
God bless you.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?
No, no, no.
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
Good--then listen.
What's that?
No, that is not belief.
I got him on the knee!
Don't bump me.
Hey!
Drive off your back leg.
Fun?
Why you shaking me off?
Fastball.
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
How come you don't like me?
This is from Tony for the rainout.
Party without me.
Can I ask you something?
I was playing naked.
I was great, eh?
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?
Write this down.
What's wrong?
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
I'm going to the Show.
I'm trying to thank you.
Settle what?
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
I'll take you back to the hotel.
Nuke.
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
Sorry about last night.
Nuke--  Good luck.
Crash Davis?
I'm too old for this shit.
I don't know.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Step outside, pal.
I don't believe in fighting.
I'd kill ya.
Who you calling a "boy"?
I gotta go now, Dad.
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
Well tell 'em, honey.
Where's Ebby?
Little high.
He walked eighteen?!
Ohyeah.
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.
Eight and twenty-four.
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
What the hell's going on out there?
What'you want, kid?
Crash ain't there.
Goddamn, that's great!
Thank you.
Look at yours.
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
Hi, Ace.
Hey, I need a room.
He even played golf with the President.
...stupid things.
...been right, but who knows?
No, you're not calm.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
Stop -
Look, look.
Yeah.
She's my wife.
Okay.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Hello.
You understand?
Now this is just a signature card.
Sam, let me ask you a question.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
Dad!
When did this happen, honey?
You don't know?
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
Yeah, we made a great pair.
It was eight.
What's that?
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
Okay, Sammy.
But I saw it another.
Ohh!
No, I didn't know that.
He insulted Billy.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit.
You better watch yourself.
' .
Motherfucker.
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
Hello.
No, no it's okay.
Hey, Ace.
You think he got the point?
...okay?
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
Yeah.
What are you doin'?
Ginger called me.
I know.
Hello.
Yeah, what are you doin'?
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Hey, house is doin' well.
Okay, thanks.
Son-of-a-bitch.
Oh, yes.
You go and put your things away.
This is Jennifer and Nick.
Hello.
Want something to drink?
Legally, she can't take that stuff.
We need this guy.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
This woman's an institution.
To Abraham Lincoln.
Sam, we got a problem.
Now, he's really pissed.
He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please.
Okay. Just take it easy.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
Okay, thank you for asking.
Any change?
She took care of the dealers...
Within no time, everything was set in place.
You all right?
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
Want to go? Let's go back in.
You're kidding?
You're so wonderful.
Hi. Nice to see you.
Hey, do you want to see this one?
Okay, want to go with Mommy?
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
Huh?
You remember when you called him that night?
Huh?
I was just tryin' to help him.
Listen.
It's okay.
Well, that's why I'm here.
Hello.
So, what'd ya do with it?
The good part was, I had Amy back.
Yes, I want to kill you!
Get off of me! Stop it!
I want you out of here!
The arrangement is over!
You're lower than a dog!
Here.
Yeah, no kidding.
Stop!
I am not!
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
Oscar wants you to call him.
Hi, Sam.
Get - Get up! Get up!
I wouldn't -
Now you need approval from him to go home?
She, she's alone.
You are not threatening me anymore!
I won't let her in.
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
Should I let her in like - ?
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
...Well, I've got a large family.
It won't happen again, Sam.
Loose machines are right back over there.
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots?
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
...worst possible time for me.
Ah, yes, here we are.
Look what they did to my hand, man!
Excuse me.
I just wanna get out of here.
When I left here with the money...
No, no? You didn't?
Fuckin' kids at home!
Hey... you got a minute?
I don't want to go to Europe.
You know where she gets this from!
Yeah, that works out.
No, I don't want one.
Go back inside!
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
He won't let me in my own house!
Fucker!
Can I go in?
Um, I'm gonna need a bag.
No, you can, you can.
You just - Just stop him.
What do you want?
Hey!
All right. Okay, okay.
Come on. I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Leave me alone!
You called my friend a faggot?
You took your boots off?
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
Do you see that?
Forget about it, Nick.
He's comin' over.
Oh.
Carmine left?
Hey, Nicky, how are you?
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
Carmine?
Artie!
Hey, Frankie.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
You got a round figure on it?
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Ace.
Hey, Nick.
Uh-huh. Good.
Hi, Jennifer.
Tell me.
Well, you gotta understand it.
He didn't have to hit him.
Thanks.
Thank you.
You just relax.
He's so fuckin' lucky.
You did.
No, he's not.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
What did I tell you?
Ah, you fuck!
Get the fuck out of here.
I'm going' to the FBI!
Great.
...same outfit.
Yes!
I'm sorry.
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that.
Come on.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Well, how 'bout that?
All right.
Don't make me come there. Answer me.
...all the luck in the world.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
What does that mean?
We'll go later.
Don't give me any of your shit!
Just knock it off!
You're not gonna drive.
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
There's more!
Hey, how you doin'? 
Wow.
Mm-hm.
Well, how come I laid nine?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
Smarten up.
...you big fuckin' hick, you.
You walk past me?
And this is Stacy.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
...bosses.
I do all the work.
Mm.
He's here.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
You must have drunk too much.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Don't know.
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Whoa. Calm down.
I fucked up, Frankie.
Frankie!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Listen to me, Anthony.
Oh, God!
Tony.
I'm sorry, Nicky.
My fuckin' head.
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Hey! Oh!
I've never trusted him.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket.
Hiya.
Hi.
Yes, uh...
Hey, Hot Stuff.
The crowd bought it.
Have we reached the epi-center?
Works for me.
I'm not going to worry about it.
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
You know, nobody likes you...
He likes you.
Strange--you seemed so close.
What's the matter...
How heroic of you...
You designed Gotham Plaza?
I despise these kind of winds.
A whip?
This is insane.
Hmm. Not bad.
No-o.
Quite a pair we make.
Oh now, you put up a good fight.
This ring belonged to my sister.
Women, huh?
I better go report this in...
Selina, are you okay?
You're kidding.
We're waiting.
I can.
I've been looking for you.
You've lost all motor functions.
God, can you hear me!
Will you please stop fighting?
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
What's the catch?
Not now, Mammoth.
Yeah, this is better than rape.
What a "drag."
Right time.
God-damn..
Ah, did you hear that?
Car wash, Captain?
Well, you don't see that everyday.
You like them, don't you, Boss.
I want out of tonight's mission.
I loved you.
You're not a super-hero.
Spooky.
Hello, Spooky.
I heard what you said, Spooky.
For when the time comes..
Oh no, not a computer disc.
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
I'm a good mother!
You're late.
There you are, Selina.
Hey, you're anti-male.
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.
I don't know what came over me.
Sorry, I get carried away.
Good morning.
Next time, call...
Hey, Captain God!
Did you try to kill...
I give up.
Hey, architect--she's joking.
Lose the smile, Mr.
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police?
You're late.
Don't sneak up on me...
Where were you last night?
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
What's it like being a superhero?
You seem sad, Spooky.
You're the One.
Nice breasts.
Hey Buddy!
Was someone in an accident?
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
What if they do question the authenticity?
Who's on the phone?
What was that for?
Say something ...
I know where it is.
Will you two cut it out?
He's right, Theo.
Are you guys all right?
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
Let's have your license, mister.
What's this?
Lady, don't let him do it!
Nels reporting in.
You missed.
How do we get back to the freeway?
I told you I should've cuffed him.
He's seen both of us now.
Now turn around.
You switched license plates?
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.
What do you mean tip the cops?
Just hand up on the bitch!
Got your badge?
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
Lose the hardware now.
Don't fuck around.
He took it like a man.
Nels?
Do I know you?
Lady, try making some sense.
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
Okay.
No don't.
Fine, no tunnel.
I'm fine.
I'm with two friends now.
He's right.
"Theo?"
Why isn't anyone answering me?
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
Where's the fucking recharger cord?
What do you do for a living?
There are cables overhead.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
Lenore, I'm here.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
Does she wear glasses?
What's happening?
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
I'm not doing too well.
They'll recognize it's not your husband.
Did you jiggle the phone?
No.
Yes?  Yes?
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
It's locked.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
Who's in back?
Your friends are probably still on the line.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left.
I'm still okay.
It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.
Do you think they'll walk away?
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
What's happening?
Any idea where you're going?
Developer ran out of money years back.
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
I'm handling it.
Both hands on your lap.
Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
Know what else is in here?
Five ... six.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Who are you working for?
You're making it too easy.
Where do we meet?
I want you all in one vehicle.
I'm here.  Where are you?
Satisfied?
We're waiting on you.
I'm opening the side door.
Stop the crying.
Count it.
Seems like it.
Yeah.  Why don't we?
What's he doing?  Answer me!
Who am I talking to?
You researched me.
Yeah?
Yeah?
I can see the benefit in that.
In the hills above Sunset.
How far off are you?
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Who were you talking to?
I'm in awe.
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Why are you picking on me for?
Don't be afraid to say hello.
I already called for an ambulance.
Can I make a quick call?
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
The 405 is coming up.
Let's have your name and address.
Scottish?
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
So let's call this the usual.
It takes all types.
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
You could always make it up to her.
See that, Col?
Just cut his hair, you know.
Saw that one.
Now he can look.
He agreed that he was.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
He's still looking, Col.
Ask him.
He's back, Col
You see that, Col?
Fuck off, Dave.
You fucking promised.
Don't be like that --
Thank you.
See, they get the wrong idea.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Sure, Dave --
Take your clothes.
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Look, I'm sorry.
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
Do you mean that?
Is that his tart?
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
What's that supposed to mean?
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Someone recommend you?
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
You American?
No.
That should make her happy.
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
Jimmy.
Everybody wants something.
You old-fashioned?
Hi.
What was that?
You all right?
He's getting up.
You want me to ask you in, right?
Give me that look again.
What's that about?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
Jesus Christ!
That Dave?
Piss off, Dave!
Would you like a drink?
Someone out there.
Sorry.
He lived here with you?
He was different.
No --
You want to know how I kissed him?
What would he think?
Do you miss him?
But you can t stay, you know that?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Did he come here too?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
You mean that?
Why?
Drink.
Can't leave me now.
What you thinking of, hon?
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
Even now.
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Come on, Dil --
See, I was always best looking after someone.
You could?
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
I didn't mean to hit you.
Kind of liked you as a girl.
Do they know?
Details, baby, details.
Don't.
There's Dave. He knew too.
Am I becoming repetitious?
Don't ask me in.
Happy now?
What?
Come on.
What's wrong, Jimmy?
Dil, this is Jude.
It's her, isn't it?
Shouldn't be, Dil
She own you, Jimmy?
What you doing, Jimmy?
You do something for me, Dil?
You want another haircut, baby?
You said anything, Dil
Why?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
You want to make me look like him...
So it's true, then?
Don't call me that --
Why?
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Dil!
I had to go to work!
Come on...
So tell me.
You heard what I said, Dil?
What pills?
Are you supposed to take that many?
Are you all right, Dil?
Good-bye, Dil
Dil Can I tell you something?
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast.
Yes.
You killed my Jody?
You killed my Jody
Don't leave me tonight.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy.
Why?
You like me now, Jimmy?
More endearments.
Say it again.
And you'll never leave me?
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
What's Fergus?
Dil!!!
She was --
You've got to go now, Dil --
Promise?
Sorry, love.
Lucky you.
What was it?
Yeah.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
Fergus!
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
So what do you need, Fergus?
See does he want some.
Hey -- what's he like?
You don't know that.
Tough work, that.
Leave us, Judie.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
What was it, Fergus?
We had a court-martial in your absence.
Leave her out of this.
She's nobody. She likes me.
And then you'll leave her out of it?
And what if I say no?
You were made for this.
Jude?
You a handyman, Fergie?
Dil!
Give him a cup of tea.
Made the front page.
You're his keeper.
What the fuck is this?
So he knows your name?
Back in a minute, Jody
You OK about that?
Shut up, Jude.
Why do you want to do that for?
So it was you all the time.
I'm getting emotional.
And what's she like between the sheets?
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
Who is he?
Thank God for that.
Fuck you.
Eat something, would you?
This is a farce, man.
Thank you, handsome.
How did you know it was her?
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
What's that?
Hey --
What makes you think that?
Didn't look like that to me...
C'mere.
She'd be anyone's type.
You make a nice couple.
What the fuck am I doing here.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Take it easy, now.
Can't.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Now put it back in.
Thank you.
Fergus?
So what's that supposed to mean?
See? I was right about you.
Having two pints in the Rock.
Is it bad?
She can't help it.
See if she's all right.
Take the whole lot.
Don't.
Help me.
Go to sleep now.
Nothing.
Take the hood off, Fergus --
You stupid bastard --
The teddy bear?
Don't run off, Jude.
What if I did?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
Not here.
I never know nothing.
Come and get me, soldier --
Have you no feelings, woman?
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
I said shut the fuck up --
You're crazy.
Leave him alone, Peter.
That fucker's dead --
Give me the shooter, Jude --
All right -- where's the letter?
Oh, come on!
I could eat a horse.
Oh, you should see your face.
What's the matter?
Adam!
You don't look so bad in this light.
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
When you come on, you really come on.
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money.
What is it?
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
You're right.
Now what?
Reggie -- stop!
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
But I didn't kill anybody.
Reggie -- please believe me!
He's -- with the C.
Reggie -- listen to me!
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
I said, tell me to go to the --
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up.
Have some, please.
Do you know what C.
I believe you.
Why not?
Caf.
Yes -- ?
Are you sure there's no mistake?
It's Charles!
What now?
How long do you intend -- ?
Sorry about that.
Do I knock or something?
Keep going.
Very pretty. Now what?
Back where?
And stop threatening that boy.
That's a crock!
He's just tryin' to throw us off!
Not my room!
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
Does it hurt?
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
The phone's ringing --
They've got Jean-Louis!
What day is it?
Come on -- let's get busy.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
I think Tex did it.
I'd love some, thanks.
No sense messing up the streets.
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Got you.
Reggie -- open the door.
What are you doing?
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
I can explain if you'll just listen.
Monsieur Flix -- ?
Please keep it.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
What for?
You sure nuthin's missin'?
What do you mean, no?
Mrs. Lampert --
Yes.
You loved him?
He was American?
Is it all right?
Of course it is.
I don't understand.
I was, too.
Oh, la.
Oh, la!
Up there! It is up there!
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens!
But he is gone.
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
What are you doing here?
Where did everything go?
Hallo, Peter.
What's going on?
Of course? I thought he was dead.
Right there, between your eyes -- see?
What was all that?
En garde.
What are you doing in here?
We're here.
Peter -- are you all right?
There was no trace of him.
Go on.
I'm so hungry I could faint.
Who is it?
Yes -- that's right.
What'd he say?
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
Stop that!
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
But why do you want a divorce?
He knows everything.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
Do you know him?
Who is it from?
What is it about?
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
I don't see him.
We took all the chances.
Shoot no, not after all these years.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
Yeah?
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
I think it's funny.
I'm not fucking you.
I get all your CDs.
One more time.
Hi Jody.
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
IT'S LISA SHERMAN.
It's almost ten o'clock.
Hi honey.
I'm fine.
Hi honey.
What do you mean?
Ok.
It was a she.
You know her?
You were eavesdropping.
No!
You found her?
What happened?
Is Jody still awake?
Well?
What are you doing?
Hello?
Of what?
Can you describe her? How old was she?
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
I know where you're going.
Your brother told us.
We just found another body.
But I shouldn't shut it down?
Pay no attention to me.
You fucked me up!
I am.
You aren't going to the party?
of COURSE. You're not scared?
We're all manipulated.
Me? Why me?
What do you know about my father?
_ Your father raped someone?
Please!
Go sit next to him.
The seat behind him is open.
No! That's his table.
What am I supposed to say?
He's just trying to mess with your head.
Oh nice save.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
Not that many.
Someone tried to kill me.
You ok?
You can't tell your parents.
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
This place is empty.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
Cut it out.
I got to get home.
Are you O.K.?
All our parents are weirdoes.
Are you coming to the party?
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Please don't go.
Jody. Wait.
My dad's down there!
Go to the police station!
Thanks for coming back for me.
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
What are you doing?
Hi mom.
Lisa Sherman?
Where are you going?
Wait.
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town.
Who?
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
THAT'S why he called Mr.
Yes?
Yeah.
On what side of the family?
You ok?
What are you doing?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
You got a great mom.
You can have both if you want.
You're so beautiful.
There's Jan and Heather.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
I said no.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
Rod!
Stacy?
help me get in the truck. 
 Oh...
 Oh, shit.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Damn.
Shit!
It's a damn postal truck!
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle.
Come on, Night Shift.
A little early for a delivery.
That's my business.
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
What did I say?
Go on.
...up.
We're clear.
No cell.
Billings?
 
Oh, shit.
Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
    Elvis is on ice again.
Holy shit...
Fuck! 
 I should've had that dog bite me.
Whoo!
 Listen!  Listen...
I don't want you to come anyway. 
Keep still.
Uh-oh.
Listen, Arlo...
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
 
Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.
Ow!  
Listen, Arlo.
They're takin' off.
Hey, just shut up.
We're gonna die!
Okay. 
Okay, here we go.
Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
Oh, fuck!
We!
Here...
Okay...
Whoo!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
What the hell?
Stupid.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Shoot me. 
Mason.
All right 
Oh.
What?
Hang on, hang on.
Got it?
 Well.
You did help a little.
Patriotism is its own reward.
Oh!
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
Hey.
What'd he say?
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
I urge you to be persuasive.
Well, that just about figures for today.
Yeah, that's my truck.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
You got a prob-...
Listen, deputy.
What?  Say again...
All right, gentlemen.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo! 
Colonel Vitelli.
They were all wearing hardware.
Yes, sir.
Doc-...
"I am become Death, the...
Andrew...
Do you know what'll...
Get 'em on line, then stall.
 There's nothing in here, sir.
This is it.
 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
Dennis, radio the bikes.
...comes up that road.
Well.
Of which we have more than enough.
All right.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Hit him.
Hit him again.
Vaughn.
There.
It's clean.
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
Shit.
Dennis!
I'm on it.
This river ends at a hydro dam...
Hemmings!
We gotta get help.
Doc...
Yeah?
I want you to look at one another...
Hello.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
I don't see my container.
 
Why?
Yeah?
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
Video lock.
It's after five...
Rangers.
Geneva just pulled the plug.
Hit it...
No sign of 'em...
Forty-nine?
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!
Great.  All right...
It's not over, Brynner.
 ...that tunnel.
Is Elvis out?
That little geek is my...
Thanks. 
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
Mason?
Morning, doc.
Mason.
Call an ambulance.
The compound has to be kept cold...
You're the only one I can trust.
Yeah, I just....
Dr.  Long!
...you, Mason?
What?  Say again, Ma-...
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
Mason.  Mason!
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
Lying? 
Let me see your...
I said let me see your hands now!
 Listen, Pappas...
 Wait.
What the hell was that?
  All right.
Okay, doc.
Get in 
Gimme this god-...
Arlo.
Oh.
Do it now.
I'll stay here and secure this position.
It's too late, Mason. I've...
...gotta seal it.
Negative.  Negative.
 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Look at that.
Barney, who is this bimbo?
I'll settle for L.A. County.
Then these are all new owners?
Sir?
Always?
How did she get that idea?
Why is that funny?
At my age, you tend to lose track...
I've got the photographs in my office.
What does this mean?
How much are you worth?
Hello.
She's just no good.
They don't kill a guy for that.
...No...
I'll pay the rest next trip.
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
Sure thing.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
Then what'll you do?
Yes.
That's just lovely.
Where did you get this material?
Hello, Jake.
Thanks, Lou.
You've done well by yourself.
You're behind the times, Jake.
Congratulations.
I don't want it anymore.
What are you doing here?
Isn't that your number?
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
You were following him night and day.
I want those photographs, Gittes.
What are you talking about?
It's too late.
I know what he says.
That's it?
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
Who is he, get his name?
Get him away from her.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
No.
You and your husband never discussed her?
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Not that Mulwray?
Would you like something to drink?
My husband's at the office.
So let's just drop the whole thing.
I should talk this over with your husband.
No. I went riding rather early.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
Thank you for going along with me.
I got your check in the mall.
Sorry.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
Unless what?
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Is there anything else you want to know?
For very long?
K... Cross.
How did it happen?
Another satisfied client?
Oh, no.
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
What are you thinking?
That dam is a con job.
We got it. We got it, baby.
I'll stay.
Maid's night off?
Tell me something.
It was in Chinatown.
As little as possible.
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
Hold still. Why?
What's wrong?
Where?
What did he say?  What did he say?
I want you to listen to me.
Okay, give me the keys.
She's too upset.
Just tell me the truth.
I can't...
Did you get some sleep?
Going somewhere?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
Stop it!
That's good. Now what's her name?
I said the truth!
I said I want the truth.
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
How do you know?
Let me handle that.
Walsh here?
Sophie.
Where'd he go yesterday?
Sophie... is Walsh there?
Hello, Miss Sessions.
Shut the fuck up!
Yeah, Sophie.
Miss Ida Sessions again.
Oh my goodness.
I'm sorry. We don't.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
Can I help you?
Mind if I take one of your cards?
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.
Mr.
Wait.
You're a married man, am I right?
Mr. Gittes?
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
The water.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Come again?
It's bone dry, Morty.
Gittes?... Gittes?
Yeah?... I do?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
No, really?
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
No problem with me on the Job.
Mr. Mulwray, please.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
He owned the water department?
This?
Jesus Christ, Walsh.
Look, Jake.
So he says you sent them?
Think you can nail Mulvihill?
Yeah?
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.
What's that, pal?
Not exactly.
Lots of fellas do.
Course, she settled down nicely.
She ran off to Mexico.
You must not come here!
What are you doing here?
Signora Maria, don't do that.
Alfredo, did you know my father?
Now listen to what I've got to say.
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
Will they really find work in Germany?
It's got to be sent to another town.
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
How's school?
Yes. I want proof.
What'd I tell you?
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Now what can you see?
Eh!
Stop it!
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something?
You weren't expecting me?
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
Did you ever see her again? 
Thanks for all you've done for me.
Good morning, father.
What is it, Alfredo?
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
You understand now? You see it clearly?
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Hi, Elena!
Father, I have sinned...
I don't care. I'll wait.
You have a great future as a driver.
Elena!...But when...
So what'd they say?
No, Salvatore.
You're still beautiful...
I saw your daughter.
My husband...you know him.
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena!
But I never saw that note!
No, Salvatore.
I've been looking for you all day.
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
See how pretty the house is?
No.
How long's it been shut?
But why do you call me 'Mr.
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
That's all right.
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane -
Hey, Brad!
I've just made a shocking discovery.
Three cents.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
It's a saying, Mr.
Let's hope they like it there.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
It's wonderful, Mr.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
He's a great guy - Leland.
Yes.
Who's a busy man?
He finished it.
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr.
Wasted?
Sixty-two thousand -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
What's the matter?
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Well, he'll be coming back in September.
What's happened?
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Where is it - where's my notice?
Welcome, Mr.
Mr.
My little sanctum is at your disposal.
I'm still hungry, Brad.
But, Mr. Kane -
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Was the show covered by every department?
How do you do?
Let him finish, Charles.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
Hello, Brad -
Almost two to one -
I know it is, Brad -
What do you expect me to do?
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.
Have they heard from father yet?
Here I am, darling...  Darling!
What's this all about, Emily?
I intend to find out.
Oh!!
Oh yes, there is.
Charlie, you're just excited.
Get out, both of you!
Ow!
You've got some on your face.
What's funny now?
Oh!
Hey, you should be more careful.
Where's the soap?
You're very easily amused.
Oh!
Where's the towel?
A chicken?
Who am I?
Yes -
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
I mean it.
I won't let you go.
Goodbye, Charlie.
She doesn't know, Mrs.
Anything you say, Mr.
You do anything you want to do.
Impossible!  Impossible!
You goin', Mom?
You see!
Get Dr. Corey.
Is Mrs. Kane - 
Close the door, Raymond.
Raymond - 
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Oh, yes, sir.
Poor Mr. Carter!
Tired?
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Charles, I tell you there is no war!
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
You start tomorrow night.
What do you mean by that?
First of all - 
Charlie, it's just no go.
All right.
Emily's going south next week with the child.
She can leave me.
Hello, Brad.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
I'll sign those papers -
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!
Mr. Leland, you were -
What's this?
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Yeah, all in crates.
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
Thompson!
Who told you you could sit down here?
Why don't you people let me alone?
How did you meet him?
I did a lot of singing after that.
I didn't get a thing.
Right away.
She's plastered, isn't she?
Are you sure?
What's this?
Well, if it's already too late...
Jesus!
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
Thanks. Have a good one.
Beats me.
Excuse me, but...
Fifty-five.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
Hey, now wait a sec...
That's it, everybody out.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
Am I missing something here?
I was here the whole time.
Nobody! I swear!
Why?
When did you get back?
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside.
How'd you get here so fast?
Promise me it'll always be like that.
I'm serious.
Stop this. This isn't funny.
Are you sure somebody was back there?
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
I don't know.
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
Well he asked me for it!
What about Caitlin?
Are you open?
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
What the fuck is this?
Who are you to make assessments?
Like you're better!
That's easy to say from over here.
Are you open?
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD!
Excuse me, do you have...
Pack of cigarettes.
Awww, he's so cute.
I work in a shitty video store.
Pack of cigarettes.
Pack of cigarettes.
Cute cat. What's his name.
You open?
What am I worried about?
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
You only brought one ball?!
Shit!
You're late.
What time do you have to stay till?
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
You don't want to know.
Do you know that article is accurate?
What's that?
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
What's he looking for?
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
What did he say?
Oh, it's great.
Why do you do things like that?
No.
Thirty-seven!
Can you come next door?
Vermont?
Pull my laces tighter.
Design major.
Are you gonna lock the store?
Helluva game!
What happened to all the Gatorade?
You know what Sanford told me? 
Oh, my god.
You were saying?
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Shut the hell up.
I could never reach.
I can't fucking believe you!!
Let me borrow your car.
What's that for?
You know what?
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
That's stretching it.
What the fuck did you do that for?
Get to work.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
Who eats cock?
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
You just fucked a total stranger?
She said she did all the work.
Around three or something.
What?
That's all bullshit.
You should shit or get off the pot.
How's your eye?
You didn't have to choke me.
You still didn't have to choke me.
I threw out the stuff that got broken.
Do you work tomorrow?
Are you open?
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
He's got those love handles.
Do I know you?
You know him?
I am not.
Oh for God's sake!
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
What?
Wait a second!
What?
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Are there any balls down there?!
Go open the video store.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed!
I work, just like you.
It's not like it's a demanding job.
Be careful.
The porno mags?
All right, stupid question.
What? What is that?
How much money did you leave up there?
What the hell was that for?
Shit! Why are we getting up?
Why do you call him that?
You sucked that guy's dick?
Well...?
Hey! Where are you going?!
I'm going to school.
He still hasn't shown up.
You had to tell him.
What the fuck did you do that for?
You're damn right it's not like that!
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
Thanks.
You open?
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
I'm not out of shape!
Here you go.
What are you talking about?
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Oh shit, look who it is.
He only speaks Russian?
No way!
What did he say?
That doesn't sound metal.
Did he say "making fuck?"
What part of Russia?
Is he staying here?
He really wants to play metal?
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
I think the lady called it.
You're Dante Hicks?
To an Asian design major.
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
Really?
Holy shit!
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
Sure. How about the beach?
I just held up the same two movies.
That's the price, my brother.
And... he told you all of this?
The guy ain't here yet.
Willam!
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year.
Gabe!
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
Did you catch that thunder?
Answer the man.
C-4?
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!
Hal's signalling he's OK.
And it's such a handsome head.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Jessie, Hal, come in.
You know how the airlines are.
Looks like the Tower.
Go on, fetch.
Tucker?
Jessie!  Are you alright?
Where are you, Walker?
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
Glad you could drop in.
I'm coming out!
She's losing it!
What the hell are you doing here?!
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
How's your leg?
What are we going to do?
I'm going with you.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
How're ya feeling?
She's tough.
There you go.
Two...
Four...five...
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Do you see them yet?
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
Oh, my God!
He knows it well.
The winds are picking up.
Hello, Gabriel.
Gabe, did you come back to stay?
Thank God you didn't leave.
Can't do it?
Gabe!?
Let's be creative.
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Gabe...your arm?
We have to get through to the other side.
Nice view, huh?
What was God thinking when he built this place?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Can you see light?
Gabe are you alright?
No luck?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
We might be able to go that way.
Pull it apart!
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
Gabe!
Reach up!  Do it!
Thanks for holding on.
My heart can't take much more of this.
What do you think?
Just kidding.
What about you?!
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
Look here, the mountain man.
Where's the helicopter?
He'll freeze.
What's he doing?
Talk.
Souvenirs?
It's up there, on the Tower.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
You son of a bitch!
Murdering, motherfucker...
You said there was a way across.
He never hurt anybody.
Travers, you're not running things.
Yeah...
What's your names?
Have her come up.
On top of the peak.
He asked you, how far?
Then where the fuck is!
Go after her.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
You gotta be kidding me!
Oh, my God!
Right.
I don't know about totally.
What the hell are you doing--
Calm down.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Why didn't you send the money over?
What's the delay?
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Don't use my name!
Where's the third one, Travers?
Get off my back, Qualen!
Don't give him anything.
I don't trust him.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Man against nature, right Travers.
This way.
He's alive!
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
Good, Travers.
This is insane.
Is it set?
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
What's the code, Travers?
You got what we need?
Rich...
Mostly.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night?
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Sorry about the pain.
One minoota, droogie.
Come on, Alex.
Dear, dear, dear.
Good evening, sir.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help?
So this is the young man?
Very kind of you, sir.
Hi.
You are now a murderer, little Alex.
We got worried.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
Who said that?
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Good evening, my boy.
Hullo lad.
No thanks, Mum.
Hello, heap of dirt.
Yes, sir.
Religion?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.
No, sir.
You're absolutely right, sir.
Well, that was a very promising start.
Are you referring to the background score?
How are you feeling today?
What's all this about sin?
You're keen on music?
You needn't take it any further, sir.
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother?
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Mothballs, sir.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Don't read it - sign it!
Pitiful rookerful...
Moloko-plus.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex.
Yes, I heard.
D'you think we should do something?
Hullo, son, how are you?
How many to a cell?
Shall we go to my office?
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
Go ahead, say it.
You like Bach?
You like being a lawyer?
Not quite.
You never answered my question.
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
Annie...it's Max.
Did you say <u>Dmitri?
...he's two floors below you.
This your current address?
A deer?
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
No.
Remember what you played?
You know Dmitri?
What kind of question?
One more thing.
Lay it on me.
I see.
Tell me, Vincent.
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
What?
I picked up a tail.
You think I wanted to come here tonight?
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
Something going on?
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.
Lemme tell you something.
What are you gonna do?
Remember that thing a few years back?
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
What if they're wrong?
Why didn't you tell me we had company?
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
I was with Max when he got the call.
Client?
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
Quite an achievement...
I'm in town for a short time.
Hi, Ma.
You paid for my flowers?
I came to see you, you look fine.
Oh.
You're kidding me.
...oh God, don't shoot me...
I know you're out there!
He's not paying you one cent!
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
You hassling my driver again?
He'll keep calling.
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
Yeah?  So?
Yeah?
...why is everything always about you...
Hello?
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
How long you think this'll take?
Mind if I time you?
First time in New York?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
We have a deal.  What's your name?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
I think he's dead.
You - you killed him?
You cool, Max?
Good.  Help me out here.
I'm gonna roll him off the hood.
Got it?
What?
Max.
Max.
You listening to me?
What about that?
Try some deep breathing.
You better?
What are you doing?
58th and Central.  You know it?
Oh.
Are you breathing?
Music.
Chopin prelude.
I don't know any Rwandans.
Get rid of 'em.
Please.  Don't do anything.
That one's probably married.
Hands on the wheel.
Who's that?
It was an accident.
Don't take that.
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
Another collateral.
Vincent?
But, hey, some good news.
Let him go, Vincent.
Let's go.
Max?  What are you doing?
Pull your head out of your ass.
Show up for what?
Show up for <u>what?
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
What the fuck was <u>that?
Limos, huh?
Gimme your wallet.
I'll just hold onto it for you.
Our friends in Little Russia.
Vincent.
How long have you been a hit man?
Damn, Max.
Washington and Holt.
Would you have called her?
Good.
Get with it.
You're going too fast.
Slow the hell down!
Well.  That was brilliant.
Max?
What happened?
They said send you downstairs.
The sound of love.
That's love.
Love gives you wings.
She must be some girl.
I never told her.
Are you crazy?!
I was only going one way.
What're you thinking, Jerry?
<u>Jerry</u>?
Saved you last night's, too.
Flip.
I don't see the connection.
The President's in Europe.
You going to warn him?
I better get going.
What was your horse's name?
I bit the bastard's nose off.
What's the charge?
Just relax.
Switch 'em.
Hey.
People do have heart attacks.
It's okay.
He says a dog bit his nose.
What took so long?
Flat, wraparound headlights?
See?
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
More about life on Mars.
Well that's the eye right there.
That's it?
So why are they after you?
So I'm a little jumpy.
You okay?
You want something to drink?
If my universe had a hub...
Equitation.
Here it is.
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
What are you doing?
Was that who I thought it was?
He's why you punish yourself.
Johnny Dancer, right?
Did you see the van back there?
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
I don't know what to say.
You're wrong.
Answer me.
You look great.
Are you okay?
What is it?
We're going to Queens?
Now what?
After you.
What about them?
My father's house.
Liza?
Jerry.
Someone else might call it stalking.
How'd you get the picture?
I believe you.
You got to get out of here.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Blue moon...
Without a song in my heart.
Blue moon...
Liza?
How did you know?
Get in.
Geronimo is down.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
They changed Franklin's portrait.
I love you, too.
Do I know you?
I'm a very patient man.
What's that?
We've arranged for you to take the blame.
Liza Sutton is dead.
Thank you.
You made your decision yet?
I'll do it.
Can I ask you something?
Veritas.
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
Years ago, I worked for the C.
We experimented with hallucinogens.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
I'm still listening.
Belief is immaterial.
Where'd you get it?
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
It's okay.  I'm game.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Liza, settle a bet for us.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Yes.
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
Ah, your psychotic is here.
Tell him I'm on vacation.
Go to the northeast corner.
Guy's a C.
Which way did he go?
You're welcome!
Agent Lowry.
Can I talk to you a second?
Do you believe me?
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
What gave me away?
I'm, it really doesn't matter.
What?
We've lost contact.
Is it possible...?
Dr. Arroway --
Hope there's a cartoon.
What in the hell...?
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.
Nothing.
Pepsi?  Tequila?
Peter sends his regards.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
I want you to listen to me, carefully.
What is it?  What's happened?
David --
You...
They knew our level of development.
You aren't staying?
What does it say?
What's the status of the decryption effort?
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
What...
There's no way of knowing.
What?
J39 Z186...?
Got a bogey, boss?
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
How's the spying tonight, guys?
Dr. Cullers?
Here, right around Centaurus A.
Okay, let's just slow down.
Can't we get rid of them?
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
... I don't understand it.
There is no direct evidence, no.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Talk to him.
Could we hear to China?
Pensacola.
Time to sleep now, Captain.
You're not real.  None of this is.
So who -- what -- are you?
... life is unspeakably rare.
Am I one... or many?
Eventually you'll get here on your own.
It's time to go home now.
S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
You live here.
Some kind of circuitry...?
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
What's that?
Hokkaido Island.
Why don't you come back with me?
Very well.
I'd say this is slightly different.
Ellie.  Arroway.
I read your paper on ETI's.
Ellie.
It's good to see you, Ellie.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
Ellie -- are you okay?
Peter... What is going on?
Champagne please.
I flinched.
... It's an old story.
So.
Relativity.
If you came back.
I read your book.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
Ellie --
So.  The final countdown.
You're trembling.
What...?
Ellie, what is it?
Hi.
So.
I don't know.
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
You kill me, you really do.
Oh my God...
Well.
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.
I'm lucky I got a broom.
Fifty cents?
Hot damn, Drag.
How'd you find me?
No.
Yeah.
Lookit her bounce.
Gotta have kings.
Go hard!
Tell us about it.
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
We saw the broads.
Comin' out here, Boss?
You was eyeballin', Luke.
Then how come it ain't done yet?
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Please! Please!
You got your mind right, Luke?
Go git it, Luke.
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
Here's the Patrol.
Here, Captain.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
Had it done in Singapore.
Only two?
You can't do that!
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Oh, man, did you see her?
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!
Whatcha got?
Uh-huh.
But there's still daylight left.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Lemme see it!
Oh lookit that brunette.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
Come on, Drag.
A cold drink.
That's my baby.
Somebody say somethin'?
Whatta you so happy about?
Plumb busted out.
Course not.
Slow down, man.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
Nuthin'!
Hey, buddy.
Where'd the road go?
Why'd you have to say fifty?
What did I do?
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Don't hit me no more, Boss!
Whoee, it's cold.
But, Luke...
Is that your answer, Old Man?
Dragline gives out the names here.
Not a liar.
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
All right now: get mad at them eggs.
What's the writing say?
Oh Lord!
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Man!
Man, it's so hot.
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
I'm in.
I gotta believe.
Man, you play like a kokonut.
Oh no, man!
Man Oh Man.
Kick a buck.
Back a buck.
But -- but --
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway.
You think you've been working hard.
One, two, three... 
Stop that.
He'll never make it.
I hate this...
Now look what you did.
It's good medicine.
Where were you?
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
Cellulite.
You parked right behind him.
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
What?  What'd I do?
When are you going to call them?
I can't, Andy.
None of you know anything about it.
The moon is up, my night to howl.
You're fired.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
It's almost six.
You bastard!
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.
Are you staying long?
We'll get the paramedics...
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
She just got to sleep.
Yes.  Without question.
The first two murders.
Who are you?
You don't listen very good.
Tell me what you want me to say.
Hello, Daryll Lee.
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
Hi.
What was that?
Yes.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
We'll keep talking.
Oh, please.
Who is this?
No, ma'am.
Ring the gong, he goes.
Is it an ongoing case?
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
How do you know that?
We'll show that to...
That's amazing.
We've got another one.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
Ruben.
There were needle marks.
Is that it?
Halloran.
What's that siren?
What happened to you?!
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.
Who's the married man?
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
I am not going to talk about it.
How many do you need to sleep.
Helen.
Why can't I drive home?
I don't want this.  What are they?
Somebody is imitating his m.
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
It's a game they like to play.
It's gone.
I know 'Halloran.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
Are you always so bold?
Tell me what to do!
The lock...
It's a woman shot in a car?
Don't hang up!
Yes.
Open the door.  Please.
He was in my apartment!
You know how to use this?
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
Hello.
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
I was.
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
It's none of my business anymore...
Quinn will be here any minute.
I heard. Good police work.
Answer it.
Snotty neurotic bitch...
What's wrong with him?
Absolutely.
She's blue as hell.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
Now listen up, Ruben.
What's Abba?
The woman was in shock.
I'll talk to Conrad myself.
You messed with the scene.
I tagged the goddamned stocking.
There was no sperm.
Sergeant?
Don't swear at me because we got problems.
Oh, maaaaan?!
So what have we got?
Where you going?
You want mine, too?
That was Bundy.
I just got here myself, Susan.
Detective Niccoletti?
He's not treating her right...
Put in the Kevin Costner.
See, now you've annoyed her.
Where were you?
Poor darling.
There, that's better.
Not a lot of action here.
Is that a gift from Wendel?
That's going well, then.
Where's the car?
You'd better drive him.
I thought that was you, up there.
I wasn't driving.
The traffic... where is everyone?
I don't think we should have come here.
You haven't told me where we're going.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
Do you want a cigarette?
Who is that?
Please finish your story.
Are we allowed to park here?
Can you drive?
What is it?
What does he want from you?
Crash victim?
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
It's very.
He must have driven through a pool of blood.
I need to see you, Ballard.
Hello, Letitia.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
What kind of place is this?
Do we have to talk about this?
The medicine's still bothering me.
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday.
What's up with you?
Just go ahead and tell us.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
How?
Maybe.
Maybe, though.
You know what, Ruthie?
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
What do you think of this one?
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
Yeah, everything's under control.
What about this one?
Hi, Mom.
Go on, Letty.
How can I help?
Fuck me.
What's all the dreck?
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
What do you think?
Do we have to talk wedding details?
What's his name, Letty?
I don't think people even noticed.
You did the right thing.
I was so sure.
How wonderful, darling.
Are you sure, Dear?
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Tell us every detail.
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Oh no.
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm here, Sweetheart.
Yes.
I'll see you soon.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
Which flowers did you order?
I haven't had a crush since I was
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
I'm only looking out for you.
Must you walk so quickly?
Mom, we agreed.
Honestly, Letty.
Michael just got a job.
I'm really not that hungry.
Letty, you should be in bed.
It had this red spot on its back.
You've been so great.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
No, 79.
Chair, cup and ball.
Yes?   Go right ahead.
A while, I guess.
Hey there.
Don't take it personally.
What are you looking to read?
But you're checking it out.
He asked me to marry him.
What have you done with the ring?
Guess which hand.
Really, this isn't funny.
For a price.
We're supposed to be asleep.
We'll get caught.
Nervous?
A daisy for the lady.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
Shocking, huh?
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
What else would you do?
Then it's over.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Well?
Tell me all.
Just checking.
Furnished?
Where to?
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
Wow.
I love the pillows.
It's TV heaven.
You've got to see the kitchen first.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Hey.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
Michael.
Not yet.
Good luck.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
This must be Beast.
I bombed.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
The store was busy.
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
How may I help you?
Aunt Lily?
Something like that.
Bye, Uncle Cort.
What is it? Are you OK?
What do you mean not taking your meds?
Silly?   Silly am I?
Don't upset my Mom.
I guess we need to talk.
I sure know what that feels like.
I'm sorry.
What are we going to do?
I love you so much.
I guess I should go now.
So, another one bites the dust.
Can I put these here for tonight?
My math program.
Yeah?
What are you doing?
You don't have a fever.
But what about that math project?
I don't think so.
You know what I think we need?
What are you doing?
Of course not, no.
No.
I had to smuggle it in here.
No, you've done a perfect job.
Sure.
What's so urgent?
You can tell me anything.
You what?
Of all the crazy things.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Getting back.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
Well, I understand.
It's a very nice letter.
All tapped out.
How's it look?
We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet.
Agent Hadley.
What are you doing?
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
You want the tapes for yourself.
You want the tapes for yourself.
Zero.   That's all I know.
This is turning to shit.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Hey man, you can't do that!
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
Hello?
Yes.
You've already robbed the safe?
Where's your brother?
Hey Daniel!
Hello?
Good.
Can I offer you something.
Frankie, come in.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
They're gonna be what?
Someone else coming?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid.
And for my help I would get what?
This plane will take you to Canada.
Tonight?
I don't know.
For what?
You know what makes a good get away driver?
Not a good idea.
Yeah.   We just go home.
Forget the money!
Why not just steal another one?
Get that, will you?
Why is everything an argument with you?
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
Hopefully no one.
He said to go fuck yourself.
We are being watched.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
Bring me the scissors.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
Turn on the flashlight.
Do they come with batteries?
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
That moron.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
Fuck you!
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
We still have to get out of here.
This is Zero.
It's not?
How'd it go?
What's the big deal?
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
It makes sense.
All right, knock it off.
Hadley --
It's not your fault, Daniel.
Okay.
Hello?
What's he joking around for?
Anybody hungry?
What?
Did you have to use that much explosive?
I'll be right back.
Yeah?
There's ten grand in here.
Okay, we're square now, right?
Maybe you should call the police.
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
What'd I tell you?
Hey boss, it's not a science.
They were all French guys.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
What'd you guys find?
What hotel?
The map said to go left.
There has to be.
What do we do?
They don't have a wine list.
There's an exterior alarm system.
What about transportation?
No, I didn't.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
They don't serve wine here.
I don't know.
I knew this was a mistake!
This is bad.
Oh, man... this is bullshit!
I am not comfortable with this.
I'll drive.
This is a car.
I knew I should have driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
No.   How much?
How about Canada?
Going somewhere?
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
-- I want to be Elvis.
We have a problem.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
You guys used to work together?
It's good.
This is great.
Fine.
How's my brother?
What happened?
Anybody know about that car outside?
Mr. Zammito?
Yeah.
I am Raymond.
Oh, Pepe Le Pew.
How are we going to do that?
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.
He speaks about himself in the third person?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
I think we went the wrong way.
Holy shit.
How do we know what room she's in?
The money isn't here.
I said knock it off!
You're not helping.
I say we make him pay first.
Algeria.
I can't even hear myself think.
They send us to Zammito's house.
It has to be at Sophie's.
And how do we do that?
They killed our friend.
I wasn't expecting this many of you.
When do we go?
You ever hear of jet lag?
You like shoes?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Who's gonna see it there?
Can't sleep?
What are you doing?
I really thought we had something special going.
Who are you waiting for?
Why?
Frankie, I --
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
She seems pleasant enough.
What's this?
You're back!
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
Who are you?
I don't care about your sword.
Where's your master?
Do you think you are a real master?
Go ahead.
Who are you?
Hello.  What is your name?
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
Please sit.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
I'm tired now.
This spells trouble.
Yes, I am.
I've missed you.
You're doing calligraphy?
You write gracefully.
Please.
You say she killed a policeman?
Here you must be in proper attire.
You, sister...
Don't touch it!
You can't die!
Take my horse and go to the compound.
Stop it!
What do you want?
Give it back!
The antidote exists.
Lo?
You shouldn't have come.
Let's stop a moment.
Well, there used to be!
You've got quite a temper.
No more hitting on the head!
Out here, you always fight for survival.
Your father's men are still looking for you.
Don't send me back!
Keep it safe.
Go.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.
The Green Destiny Sword?
Come with me to Peking.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
No.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Don't you want to see her again.
We're close to your headquarters.
What happened?
My blood will soon reverse its flow.
Mu Bai, hold on.
We know who stole the missing item.
It's Jade Fox!
You're mistaken.
They're gone.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
We must be careful.
Sure it coulda.
And you're gonna tell me who.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Talent. Hi.
No onions though, okay?
Speak up.
Don't thank me.
Could be.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
Listen:  Top Dollar.
You, my friend, are dead.
You died, man.
You okay, man?
My name.
Halloween is coming, soon.
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
It's done.
They couldn't do anything for me.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
Don't interfere.
Mom --?
At least it finally stopped raining.
You look like a rock star without a job.
My mom works over there.
I can pick out a tune now and again.
Do you feel okay.
What's going on...?
You brought flowers.
I remember him!
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.
Now do you get to see her?
I don't know if I can.
What's goin' on, Elly?
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
You're not a cop, either.
You buying?
Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.
A year ago.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
A year ago.
Who gives a fuck!
Cute nickname, don't you think?
Top Dollar.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.
I wish to possess what you have now.
And how many lives have you destroyed?
How the hell did you do that?
Neither.
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!
What the hell are you?
Having fun yet?
Get it?
Glad to see you're finally with the program.
Your job is done.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.
You'll be alone.
Don't waste my time.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
Did you see an animal of any kind?
What... the hell is that?
That thing is poisonous.
Give me a break.
Do you know of spirit assassins?
We've got company.
I've got him if you want him.
An unexpected pleasure.
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?
I'm Kathryn.
Have we met?
Are you okay?
Thank you.
Nothing.
Annette, how long have we known each other?
You promise not to say anything?
So what year are you going into?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
How's the water?
About what?
You're naked.
That's repulsive.
Need a lift?
It was fine.
And that's a bad thing?
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
No, not at all.
What are you reading?
Sure. Have a good night.
Alone again.  What are you up to today?
It's weird.
That's okay.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Am I bothering you?
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
You know what?
You really want to know?
I just came to say goodbye.
How am I a hypocrite?
Please don't go.
Hi.
I'm fine.
Hi.
Would you like a tour?
This isn't working out for me anymore.
It's not you, it's me.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
You don't know how to love.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
I think he's telling the truth Valmont.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
Well, I guess it's getting late.
What are the boys like?
Where did you find those?
I'm in the bath, mom.
What was that?
Are you for real?
See that wasn't so bad.
That was cool.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Listen to me.
Who is it?
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
If that's what you call it.
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
Now listen.
It's like a secret society.
What year are you in?
Excellent.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry that was out of line.
Okay, okay.
Please please please.
Just a kiss, right?
What are you doing?
Want to join me?
Am I suppose to be this sore?
I like it better when I'm on top.
You think?
Where are you going?
Jesus.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
My daughter, Rachel.
Hi, mom.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Oh baby... oh baby...
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Whoa!
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Annette Harrison?
Positive.
Is she with you?
Pleased to meet you.
What do you do?
Hello.
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
What's wrong?
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Lovely.
Oh, poor baby.
Sorry.
I don't find this very funny,
Why not?
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
Oh gee, your journal.
What are the terms?
You can put it anywhere.
Fuck her yet?
You would not believe what--
What's wrong with you?
The plot thickens.
I'm at your service.
I hate when things don't go my way.
Moving along quite well.
Who are you calling?
Are you really?
You amaze me.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile.
That her?
Shut up.
Morning!
Bad time?
You didn't?
Some other time.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
I'm sorry.
That's not fair.
Why so nervous?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
Devastated beyond repair.
I thought we should celebrate.
Well done.
To my triumph, of course.
Silly rabbit.
Get off me!
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
You're too kind.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable.
I can't thank you enough.
Let me get that for you.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Got me off the streets?
Hi. Is Annette at home?
It's desperate that I talk to her.
What do you want?
I'll do that.
Right after we played backgammon.
I said, do you want some water?
What time is it?
Wow.
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles.
Hey Ronald.
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
Ronald, I'm sorry.
Oh, hello.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
I love the smell of pine.
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream.
You get your wish!
What are saying, darling?
What song, dear?
Mommy --
Where did you get this ring?
Someone gave it to you?
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Where'd you get this, darling?
Oh, thank you, darling.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
Where is everybody?
Something's haywire,
Did you hear the child out?
What is it, Alice?
Ollie.
I haven't had my breakfast.
Where did you get it?
What's funny?
Oliver, please.
I thought you were with Amy.
Hello, Amy.
I got lots of presents.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Amy, not that old tree!
Amy, make a wish.
What do you want. Amy?
Now Amy
No, I didn't.
I'm sorry.
These are all from me.
Just you wait!
Daddy!
Amy, answer me.
It isn't a secret.
Amy, there's nothing there.
Yes, she was afraid.
Daddy?
What'd you get for Christmas?
Who are you?
You'll always play with me?
Can't you get it, darling?
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
All right, Amy.
Merry Christmas, Irena.
Oh, how beautiful!
Merry Christmas.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
It's you...Irena...my friend!
You mustn't be afraid.
You?
Look at my ring.
Been crying?
I wasn't singing to myself.
About time for you to come home, Amy.
Mustn't look, little miss.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
I've been watching you.
She's always spying on me.
There you are.
I like stories.
The Headless Horseman --
He'll let me stay, Mrs.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
What?
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
And does he kill people?
Hide me? Why?
Hurry, hurry.
Hurry!
I hate the storm. I hate it!
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you?
Look at me.
Mother! You called me by name!
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow.
There's another promise you must make me.
Good night, mother, good night.
Let the child stay.
What is it, ma'am?
It's dark.
You won't have long to wait.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
"To Daddy from Amy.
You'd better hurry.
She refuses to deny it.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
Waiter! She needs more water.
No way is that the same chick.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
What?
Wow your body's really hot.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
There was a sale.
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
How's the rest of your health?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
That bite healed up quickly.
Jennifer?
We're worried about you.
I have cramps.
I wonder what it's like being you.
He hasn't said one word to me.
How about I give you a make-over?
Do you really need these?
Or if there's a full moon.
Where are all the mediums?
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
I think she broke the skin.
Why did Gregory ask me out?
Where?
Hey, did you get contacts?
He's dead?
So did you do it?
Are those Mark's?
He was cute, huh?
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh?
I'm freaking out.
How'd it go with the cop?
No he didn't.
What did he say?
Charming Carlton.
Bag means condom now?
Oh my god, look.
Yes they are!
Frida, this is a bad time.
Jennifer.
Please come over.
So where's this infamous arm now?
You're a PMS werewolf.
You're delusional.
Hello?
Get rid of him!
Holy shit, I don't know.
What happened to his tooth?
How could I?
You expecting someone?
Fuck it's the cops.
What the fuck are we going to do?
Peter knows something.
I think I just got my period.
I'm cleaning my stove.
I think George knows.
I thought you and George were getting married.
Hello?
I know.
You're kidding, really?
You hungry?
I'm really tired.
What?
What, you got a date or somethin'?
You look different. I mean you look good.
Look what you did!
OUCH that stings!
Where'd you get the bike?
Frida?
It's a matter of life and death.
I did something stupid.
Mark.
Wow.
The Nielson's?
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
I can't read any more crap.
Mr.
When's the last time you saw him?
You busted me.
I gotta get going.
You wanna get some coffee?
My mom used to get PMS too.
We lived in northern Minnesota.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
I really gotta get going.
What are those?
I'm a cop -- I notice everything.
What's wrong?
Was there anything in that washer?
You sure?
Everything okay?
Uh.... hi!
You had a date with Carlton?
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
No, why?
Frida.
What happened?
Except Mark of course.
That's it?
Is it that funny?
What's with the squirt guns?
Your breasts feel larger.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy?
Hello?
Yes, sort of.
You at least owe me the truth.
Go away. I might hurt you.
How do you know?
Be careful!
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
I'm going to take a shower.
Here's a towel.
That I'm a doormat of course.
I think I'm a werewolf.
I ate a guy last night.
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt.
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
Yes... I... we had dinner.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
We can get a warrant if you like.
You heard about Carlton Fraser?
Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive.
No.
No he's not.
Come on, I've been working with Frida.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
It's for you. Frida.
Oh great.
Jesus Christ she got her period.
How the hell is that your business?
You want her sheets?
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself.
See he was cheating from the get go.
He was found a few blocks away.
I didn't trust her.
Frida's sheets checked out fine.
Maybe.
What?
She's got a hidden pitbull.
He means the last that we know of.
Seems he's stolen money from them.
Spencer's the key here.
You think mafia hit?
What are you talking about?
So.
I need something to keep me awake.
Sell maps?
Mnunn.
How long have you been here?
What's he doing here?
All the same entry wounds.
They don't speak English...
Police.  Nobody move.
Doctor!  What brings you here?
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
Please, they'll kill me...
In there.
What is this place?
Was that for real down there?
Good evening, sir.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
What about Thompson, sir?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Its extremely important to my investigation...
Lost something?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.
Dammit!
Im your new assistant.
You typed this report?
It seems fine.
How can I submit this?
Who is it?
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Where are we going?
Why give yourself up?
People...  after me.
They didn't have faces.
Go on.
Where do you think this goes?
What now?
Can't let you in...  sorry.
They've taken my mind, my memories...
Jesus!
But...  How long has this been happening?
Look!  This is a good one!
Such a joker!  Like your father.
You see it?
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
I didn't realise...
No.  I, ah...
Someones after me.
I see.
Dont kill me!
You remember nothing?
What does she say?  The woman.
Bad dreams?
If you like.
Known me for long?
Did she drown?
Horrible...
We are little more than a sum of memories.
Can I get my life back?
I'm sorry.  About before.
What are you doing?
You're a liar!
You've been working too hard.
It's a trick.
What are you hiding?
What happened to you?
What is it?
I thought it would make more sense.
How do I get there?  Tell me.
You understand what you'll be doing?
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
How much do you usually get paid?
First Lady...
They barely talk anymore.
Holy cow.
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
What's with her?
Okay, let's go over it again.
I'm not certain about...
Dave...
Be a professional.
Mr. President...
What the hell is this?
The Washington Post.
That shelter was in this bill.
.. Nothing.
Choices???
What do you think you're doing?!
You're nothing.
... what?
Oh... I'm fired?
You're fired.
Fine?
Die, you pond scum!
Where's the girl?
Till what?
Look, everything can be handled.
A condition...
We think so.
Clean.
I mean I've checked everything.
What about the wife?
Uh, let me get back to you...
When does it break?
No!...  WE didn't anything...
What's with the cameras?
Do we have anything on the budget today?
What are you gonna do?
He's not a President!
What do you mean by that?
Uh-oh...
So you want to go swimming?
I don't think so
I gotta tell ya, Dave.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.
Thanks.
You sure?
Oh my God...
It's actually kind of serious, Dave.
Will he be alright?
No.
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
Presence.
Thanks, I wrote it.
Dave!
Fine.
Gimme a quarter.
President vetoes works bill?
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.
Let's call it a night.
What do you mean you made it all up?
We've got to fix this.
`Dave'?
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Yes, Mr. President?
This is from the people of Burundi...
What are they?
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
Something like what...
Oh... Hi.
... Sometimes they do.
You ever think back to how you started.
How'd you get started?
Your government needs your help.
Really?
So you just protect the President the whole time?
You ever use it?
Call Bob and Reed.
I was waiting for that jack.
You mean with you and everything?
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
Who?
Well...
What are you staring at?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
You bet.
Don't you have anything to say to me?
What?
I care about the homeless.
... How could I what?
Look.  If there was some mistake...
... . Ellen.
That was quite a thing you did today.
I mean, what is it?
When were you all planning to tell me?
You're leaving?
Where's home?
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
How were you gonna get home?
You sure this goes somewhere?
You don't have to keep walking with me.
What?
Are you hungry?
I really don't have much of an appetite.
That's a secret.
You know, secretaries and stiff.
It was okay?
Well I guess...
What?
What's wrong?
They're crucifying you out there.
Yeah.   He's a good man.
Hi.
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
I never thought I'd...
So this is it?
It could be fun.
The Monroe?
We're all set,  sir.
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
Please....shoot me.
Help me get him to the boat.
His madness....could be from shock.
What is it?
It's some kind of.
What do we do?
It can't be.
What is it?
Are you alright, Doc?
I know it hurts.
You'd hold us back.
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence.
Miss Henried, I think you better...
Sir. It's quite clear that...
The great state of Florida.
Bees.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
I can find it myself.
They seem to be havin' a good time.
Let me go!
Toby's right.
Looks like just two.
What is it?
How long do we have to watch him?
It's alright.
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier?
There ya go.
It won't work.
This stuff really works? No shit?
That's the general alarm.
I didn't realise!
He is dying. He knows it.
Prayers have no power to save.
Dios mia.
TONY....TONY....
NOOOOOOOOO!
Come, come, Miss Science.
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
You're....you're disgusting!
Julie Grant is a behaviouralist.
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today.
Sir.
Toby.
Mary.
Where are you going, Tyler?
Step up here, Tyler.
You fired that shot, didn't you?
It's been fired.
Hey, Tricks.
Tricks...Jesus...
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
Well, I'd better find Patsy.
Sounds boring to me.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
Do they go to Henley Hall?
Charlie Dalton.
How was dinner?
Thigh man?
I don't know.
I feel like I've never been alive.
God, I can't take it anymore!
Can you believe it?
How'd it go?
What do you mean you don't know?
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Well...
Well, of course not.
Oh God, it's over now!
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Mr. Keating!
Yeah?  Like what?
It's such a strange name!
Yeah!
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
I think he's sweet.
You know what really excites me about you?
Nuwanda?  Please?
Don't stop.
Welcome.
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
Welton Academy, hello?
Who else was involved in this?
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Hey, he's your roommate.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Who's in?
Charlie, That was great!
Charlie...
Where'd you find them?
You what?!  How did you do that?
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.
What happened? Were you kicked out?
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
This is stupid.
It's all right, Chet.
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Don't stop.
What are you doing?!
You fucked up little prick!
Pleased to meet you.

Knox, I don't believe this!
Chris!
Of course I know you!
Look, I've got to go.
I have to go home. Chet might call.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.
The hoi polloi.
And don't limit poetry to the word.
Oh Captain, My Captain.
We used to meet here on special occasions.
A yawp?
Good god, boy! Yell!
Come on boys, don't be shy.
Mr. Keating?
What did the name mean.
What did your father say?
Too bad.
You really think I should forget her?
Damn.
All right!  What'd she say?
Wait a minute.
All right.
They're friends of my dad.
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
Where are you going?
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.
Any group pictures in the annual?
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
I gotta get to the tryouts.
But father, I'm assistant editor.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Father!
Don't you dare talk back to me!
Weird.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
What is this, a midnight study group?
Look at this.
I hear we're going to be roommates.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
So what do you think of my father?
Want to come to the study group?
What is it then?
I've found it.
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
Todd, what's the matter?
This is your desk set.
Here, villain, draw and ready.
You should come to rehearsals.
Visit from my father.
You the Captain?
Who are you?
It's not going to help us!
They are...they are everywhere.
Who?
And what? These things are octopusses?
You remember the first time we met Finnegan?
Right here...middle of nowhere...
This isn't right Finnegan.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
We were talking about my schedule...
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
Where are my men?
Hanover, listen...
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Shut up!
Who gives a shit about aft?
Maybe we lost them.
I'm not staying here!
Now look what you did!
What other bunch?
Unless you collected on the insurance...
Noooo!
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
You don't have to be so touchy.
I don't know where it is!
Got it?
Like cattle...
What's the matter?
What is it?
Looking good...
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan!
It's not them...it's it...
Oh my god!
Finnegan...
How about noise?
You want ME to go up there?
Where's you friend?
Let's just keep going.

Finnegan, what the hell was that?
Joey... Which way's aft?
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
You know what I think?
Man, don't go up there...
She's gone...
Or maybe not.
I mean...where is everbody?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger.
Where are you going?
Why don't you back off?
You know what my goal is?
What was that?
Check it out!
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
What's there to think about?
She fucked you?
She fucked us both.
Fuel up. Need fuel.
That's mustard!

Wait! First I give you special fuck!
She's in back.

You seem... disturbed.
How extremely clever.
Who the hell is he?
You can do it, Sal.
Merle?
Where are we going, Merle?
Sal!
Humper's ready.
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
You should have put that on last night.
I just wait. You know?
You think about it?
Nick, he just came back.
What'd he say?
Is he from here?
You think we'll ever come back?
It's ahead, by the tree.
Hey, Nick?
We gotta play with more bullets.
How many bullets?
Merle...!
How's Linda?
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
Here, here! This is it!
Sure I got boots.
You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle.
Where's Vince?
Not tonight?
Don't worry what it says in the book.
See you Monday.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
Sal, we need you. We need you.
Sal, you're gonna die!
Did you go hunting.
Maybe you could use socks, Nick.
It's Merle, Sal.
Oh cards, maybe.
He's getting married... and we're nuts!
Well, who'd you get married to?
Cynthia! Sure.
What the hell's that for?
How's it feel, huh?
You're full of shit!
Just like always!
What the hell was that!
Quiet!
Up I would say... What would you say?
Down I would say... What would you say?
Up a little there... What would you say?
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
Yeah?
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
Michael called yesterday.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
Who is it?
My man Dubbs.
I want to ask you a few questions.
Funny guy.
Speak up.
I worked for him.
It was Wade's old partner.
Twenty years have passed, Wade.
I'm not on the force anymore.
What's this?
Mug sheets.
Edicon system made these.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
You're working a partner on this.
Hello Wade.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
You can't kill me.
I want to stop aging.
This is a war, Wade.
Just got the call.
I'm wasting time.
What is it?
I don't want to hear anymore.
That's not your zone.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
Kill him... kill him.
You two fucks listen up.
Sir, your transmission's fading.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
What do you mean he's escaped?
Just great.
Sir, your limo's here.
You okay?
Okay, that's all folks.
Sir---
Need help?
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
You my partner?
I drive.
Does it drive itself, too?
I have to go home, Sanchez.
See those guys?
They're going to rob that bank.
I'll inform dispatch.
You can't turn him off.
Wanna come?
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
Can I ask you something?
Then what goes on in there?
Hey, buddy...
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.
Why?
Married?
What's this place?
Yeah.
She's pretty.
You need anything else?
I'll have a cup of coffee?
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
Wanna try?
Let's roll.
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
Rip Van Winkle.
What's this?
Sanchez...?
Yeah.
You okay?
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
I just heard.
No.  I want to be with you.
You should be in hospital.
Demolition Man.
He had a partner.
You all right?
Yes.
I'm going to be a policeman.
Bye.  Thanks.
Hi.
Funny.
Papers.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
I'll take it.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
We'll cook 'em ourselves.
The people, Jabez -- the people.
Hey, you!
What are those people doing there?
Who are these people?
Jabez -- ?
You're not resting well, are you?
That's my business.
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
Gee -- that Fair --

Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Yes, you did, Daniel!
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.

What do you want?
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
You're not -- Dorothy.
Never mind. What's your name?
Stevens!
Mornin', Jabez ...
Now run along, Daniel.
What's the matter with you?
Do you deny that you called me?
Where did it come from?
It's mine?
No, no! Give it to me!
Excellent.
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
Why, Mr.
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr.
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
You win.
Well -- Mr. Webster!
They make plucky women in New England.
There's nothing like it.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Coming along, Jabez?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Oh!
But -- I was just lucky.
Howdy, Squire!
You keep that -- that's for you.
Jabez -- help!
Down, Shep! Down!
What is that smile on your face?
I think his leg is broken.
He's stubborn as a Stone.
Well -- what are we going to do?
Jabez!
Mary--
I'll get the doctor.
It feels fine now, Jabez.
What do you think of that, Jabez?
We must go on home, Jabez.
But I'm glad to be home again --
Mary --
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Mary --
Well -- I -- I-
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
Why don't they come --
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
Jabez -- Jabez!
You know that, son.
There!
What's ailing that dog?
You found it in the barn, hey?
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
You see, son?
Oh, here you are, Jabez.
Ma -- is she? --
You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
I want you to fix these fish!
My son ... what's the matter?
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage.
Hello, Sheriff.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
Come in, Sheriff.
Let her be, son.
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
She'll do nothing of the kind!
What are you looking for, Colonel?
It is.
Jabez ...
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast.
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
Mr. Webster, I presume?
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
I wanted to give it all to the church.
I'm John McClane.
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
The girl was off today.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
You're all right, Argyle.
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.
One of yours?
-- ten blocks?
What's happening?
Where are you going?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
What am I, a method actor?
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
You're very perceptive.
Nothing...
I know what you are feeling.
No.
Hans, he killed by brother --
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
It's beautiful.
Yes.
The code key, please...?
I don't know it!
Bad for your health anyway.
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
Hear that?
You...you're an American?
Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
Hans.  Your Hans.
Nein, dies ein ist mein.
How long?
Yo!
Three down, four to go --
Encourage them to be bolder.
I...have a request.
Go on.
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
What are you doing?
They would, huh?
...I've missed you.						*
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
John!
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.

Hi.
Hey guys.
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
HARRY!
Excuse me?
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
What?
HARRY? Are you okay?
What are you wearing?
Okay.
Hey look, it's our teacher.
The name's Walter.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Wow, a treasure map!
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Mom, you know that never works.
Then a sleep-over is okay by me.
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
I think it's just over there.
Yeah, dangerous cult.
God, she's beautiful.
Who's Principal Collins?
H A R R Y...
One day they'll find a cure.
...oh also, we even have a slogan.
Wow!
Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
Got any crazy eights?
Oh, yeah.
Whoa. What was that?
That would be me, sir.
Collins is a great man!
HARRY.
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
Nice jugs.
You're it.
You're it.
Can he do that?
These are really cold, huh?
Owww... refreshing.
I don't know. Owwww.
My head is suddenly killing me.
Owww.
LLOYD, where've you been?
What?
Nope. I was right.
Uh oh.
That's a cow, Harry.
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
HARRY, can you hear me?
You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?
Do you want me to pet your head?
Don't snap at me like that.
LLOYD, what are you doing?
HARRY! I found the treasure!
No one knows?
A raft.
George Washington!
You're it.
It's okay. I want the rush.
Hey, it's Jessica.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
No wonder we both struck out with her.
Cute puppy.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
You found my treasure?
Enough!
Hey Lloyd.
That makes total sense.
What? What did we do?
A float!
Ready Lloyd?
Wait, wait!
Guys, this is much better.
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Hold up.
The one on the left.
She's one of a kind.
You take her.
Sorry, Charlie.
Beats me.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
I thought I told you to get lost.
You had some questions.
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
Well, what have we here?
TURK, leave him alone.
TURK, what are you doing here?
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd.
Why ith dat newth?
Yes, what?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
What are you doing here?
What?
Where'd that come from?
So, when can we do it?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Well, something stinks.
What are you doing?
I'm so close I can feel it.
That's my boyfriend.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
Do I know you?
Hello, little orphan boy.
What?
How much homework is there?
Sure.
Hey you two. Lights out.
Mrs. D!
How was that?
Senior year.
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
Your assignment is to pick the class.
Sorry, Ms.
That's not bad.
Obviously.
Let's go Margie.
Looking for a scoop, huh?
Left here! Left!
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
I think you did it.
I'm not sure if I can do this.
I am strong!
God, I've missed you.
It's the big potato.
You said "aloha" twice.
Times two.
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
So far so good.
Knock knock.
So what do you keep in there?
Oh, just like the President.
Where is it?
It was Jessica.
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
I sold all the wind instruments.
This is horse?
My Lord!
It was Feyd?
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
My thanks.
What happens now?
What's that you're saying?
Yes, my Lord.
We have just folded space from Ix...
You must share with us.
Can you hear me?
I can assure you...
So, this is Leto the Just...
Yes, Sire.
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
No music.
What's gotten into Gurney?
We'd have joined each other in death.
Things have been so serious here lately.
Gurney.
This is a Harkonnen animal.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
Stop!
Sayyadina.
You know the ancient tongues?
Do you know this my lady?
Maker?
Don't touch my mother...
Remove her gag!
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
Listen to me!
Run!
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Man-carved steps.
Stop him yourself.
Are you a Fremen?
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Will we see a worm?
Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
Liet?
Water on Arrakis!
The Water of Life.
My own name is a killing word.
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Long live the fighters!
What's in the box?
The Voice again.
THE PAIN!
I sense your teachings in him.
... Many men have tried.
Don't try your powers on me.
You mustn't speak of...
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Many dangers exist on Arrakis.
Greetings.  I am the Count.
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
Uh, beg to differ.
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis.
Eddie, where are we?
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
Who are you?  What do you want?
Why were you buying a coffin?
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula.
Oh, there's my bus.
But you're a big star!
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.
Shh!
Ugh!
Vampira!
I am getting tired.
Are you sure this is okay?
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
Ehh, your part's a little different.
Bela!
You're right, Bela.
Look, you seem a little agitated.
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
Sure.
Those bastards at Universal.
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
Bela, what happened?!
Should I call a doctor?
Is there anything I can get you?
What's in the needle?
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
No Bela, that's "incorporates.
Bela, don't worry.
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
Bela, are you ready?
You'll be sitting on the right.
What is this place?
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
Let's shoot this fucker!
Goddamn, it's cold!
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Bela.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Why are you here??
What are you doing?
Don't worry.
What happened?!
I've got some good news.
Eddie, I wanna make another picture.
Okay.
And, cut...
Sorry...
Last night was quite a romp.
Eddie, I want to thank you.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
Jesus!  Are you serious?
I've never seen anything like him!
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
And, CUT!
Um, okay... roll camera
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take?
I got the early edition!
You really think so?
What happened?
What do you think you're doin'?!
You don't understand!
Wow.
There's no such thing as a psychic.
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Excuse me.
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Honey, what if I'm wrong?
Eddie, I don't understand.
Sweetie, you won't believe it!
No!
Ed, I'm so proud!
How long have you been doing this?
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?
It's a damn good role.
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
From today on, our lives are different!
Look on the bright side.
I'm no good.
All I wanna do is tell stories.
Ed, the landlord called again.
Goddamn landlord.
You're a fuckin' mess.
Honey, you made it!
That's Tony McCoy.
Dolores, wait!
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
I kinda need it now.
Hey big shot, get off your ass.
So what are you bringing me?
Oh, "Dr.
Mr. Wood?!
Yeah...?
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
Okay -- you know what you do?
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"!
What'd you give him all the lines for?
And PERFECT.  CUT!
Mr. Reynolds!
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Could we moovf to table?
So, Mr. Johnson --
Edvard!
Tor, dialogue is overrated.
Here's the scene.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
Tor, I should be getting home.
My eyes are killink me.
What is happening?
Excuse me, Sir...?
I can't believe it.
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Can I help you?
Is there a script?
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
Lugosi?
Ed!
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
But I'm proud.
Georgie, what's with the stag footage?
"Where's the ads"?
Hello.
What are you making?
Oh, it's you again.
Oh, flowers!
So have you always lived in L.A.?
Did you find it boring?
Oh.
That <u>is</u> incredible!
Stop!
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
What was that?
Those assholes.
You should feel lucky.
Look, it's Dr.
I can't get it to go up.
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
I don't understand.
No, don't worry, I moved on.
I'm really sorry...
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews.
The set doesn't look right!
Just like I always promised.
Uh, yoo-hoo.
Wow, this lab looks great.
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
You're sure this is gonna work?
Hey.
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
What are you talking about?
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
This is our choir director.
Mr. Wood?
B-but it's our money --
Why... yes.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl.
What the heck is THIS?!!
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
No.
I'11 have to pass, Al.
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
What do you love her or something?
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
How's your mother?
You thought it was me?
Did you see that?
I'11 tell you something else.
You think she really likes him?
What did you study?
Ed, can I see you a second.
Now look.
Yes, Ed.
How you doing, Ed?
Yeah?
They tore her dress! ...
Yeah.
Ed, everything goes off.
I don't think so.
He's who we want to go with.
Take him off the air.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic.
Where are you going?
Mr. Pekurny.
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
What?
You know who we are?
Oh, that thing.
Yeah.
Eddie? ...
Ma, do you know where Ray is?
I know you.
How's Marcia? She all right?
I can't believe you're taking his side.
I told you the facts!
Yes.
He had girlfriends!
Oh my God.
Eddie...
What happened?
What?
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Ed! How did you know I was here?
What's going on over there?
Right, yeah --
Hi, Mom. 
Hi. Is Shari here?
She won't.
I can't?
No!
What are you doing?
Oh!
Are you asking me?
What does this mean?
How much less?
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
Hey, Lou.
Yeah...
Are you sure about this?
You do though, you look great.
What do you want?!
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
I mean bad.
Really?
Oh my God.
Really?
What are you doing?
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
I wish my stepfather was here.
Um...
I told you.
I have no privacy.
Page three of the Post.
I need to talk.
It's not their fault.
What do you want me to do?
You see how people look at me.
This is going right up your ass.
Kinda'.
Let's have a contest.
But facts!
What's up?
What do you mean all of a sudden?
I got your message. Way to go!
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
You would do this? You would actually --
All right.
Polish acrobat.
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
Remember the last guy she got involved with?
What are you, hiding from the Police?
Who is it?
Hi.
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no!
What is this?
I don't even know her.
Why me?
... Ray?
What are we gonna fight?
Good-bye, brother!
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
Come on, Ma.
And each contestant gets one of these.
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
Mr.
No -- keep it.
Hello.
You don't recognize me.
Who is it?
Quite a shithole, isn't it?

That girl's an idiot.
Hi.

Mostly Tammy fans
Larry?
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Okay.
I got all my signatures.
Looks good to me.
Thanks for everything.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
You're the advisor.
These are a bunch of burn-outs.
Tim Kobza?
I guess you know why you're here
Mr.
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy.
Yes?
What do you mean?
I told you!
Act surprised.
Hello, Mr. M.
So what brings you here?
Where to?
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
So Tracy?
What's this?
I want you to do something for me.
Oh, is this...?
What a surprise.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
So... what do you have to tell me?
Could you get this? I can't
Without Dave around.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
So what do you think?
Shall we give it a name?
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
Hey Yeah?
What do you want, Jim?
Who, me?
Fine.
Oh, no.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.
Just one more thing.
253.
Whoa!
What?
Where 're you going?
Are you crazy?
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
We can't both run, can we?
She's doing this to get back at me
Who put you up to this?
Who put you up to this?
Way to go, Tracy!
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Can I sign yours too?
Yes, Paul?
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
You dumbshit!
What do you want?
Now could you leave me alone?
How's the left these days?
Merry Christmas.
Somebody hit you?
Can I get you a drink?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
I remember you from Christmas Eve.
Look.  I want to see you again.
It doesn't matter.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
You found Patchett.
Did you talk to Exley?
I want to know about Exley.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
Lad, may I have a word with you?
Does that paper say we've been indicted?
What's going to happen to Stensland?
They're yours.  Take them.
Will you work for me?
Give me one minute.
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.
You know him?
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.
That's him.  That's him.
What's through here?
Don't mind the smell.
Was it... a rat?
Where are we going?
Yeah, that's Stens.
What happened?
One in six.  Where's the girl?
A naked guy with a gun?
How's it going to look on your report?
Why?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.
You expecting problems?
It's a suicide note.
Ellis Loew.
Bud...
You wanted to meet here?
You figured this was a set-up?
She's fine.
Are you Pierce Patchett?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
Thanks, but no thanks.
Officer White.
Should I?
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
Whose shoe?
Cotton balls.
Ed, your observations have been astute.
Ed, you're 30.
Jack Vincennes.
Anything?
Where are the police academy files?
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
Take it easy!
Okay so we worked together.
Okay.
And?
That was his favorite toast.
You're wrong.
Stensland's a disgrace.
Sir, I took the call.
Why?
Ed, I want confessions.
Don't get sidetracked.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.
No... Where'd the tip come from?
<u>No</u>.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
You're the key witness?
L.A.P.D.
Damnit...
I need to speak to you.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Okay, college boy, I'll help you.
What's that for?
She is Lana Turner.
What are you going to do?
What's on the call sheet?
The Nite Owl.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
Let's concentrate on my smarts.
I'm curious about you.
How was I?
I want to know why you see him.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
A police captain.
Where will you go?
It's okay.
Okay!
It seems like my Susan, but...
Let my Susie rest in peace!
My daughter was a virgin!
Big V Jack Vincennes!
We did a piece last year.
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.
No.
Not a word.
You're back, boychick.
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust.
Jackie!
Shut up!
Loew didn't go with him.
Pacific Coast Bell.
Yeah.
Have we met before?
Was it a party?
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Brill?
What happened?
DePinto's dead.
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
I just gave him my card.
Um...who's that?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
Zavitz, what?
You've got it on tape?
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
It is?
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
What kind of a question is that?
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
You knew the deal. No contact.
What <u>is</u> that?
What if I find out what they're after.
Get dressed. We're leaving.
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
Did you call anyone?
Sorry.
I intercepted phone calls.
What do you think?
That is one ugly sunrise.
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat.
What the fuck?!
Gimme that.
Think we let out enough air?
We lost 'em.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Drive.
Listen to you, "directly".
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
Pretty fast.
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
What are you dialing?
He came in four minutes ago.
Feeling lucky?
Baudmore Consultants.
I yanked this off your RV.
Hi, Mr. Dean.
Is it okay?
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
Do you see anything you like?
I think she'll like this very much.
I know, but--
Yes?
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
Did he give you anything?
Hey.
Bobby!
You're a lawyer.
Bobby?
Stacy?
You <u>swore</u>!
Stacy, don't hang up.
Is Eric in school?
Does that hurt?
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
Are you sure you're safe?
They're saying you killed that policeman.
Is it over?
It's really over?
My suitcase--
What can I do for you?
I'm sorry.
Actually, that's not true.
And then what?
How's the trout?
Here's what you asked for.
"Soon".
Ten thousand cash.
Good.
I know.
I can't.
Fuck you.
Any idea what he looks like?
Yeah?
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Your shoe.
Hey!
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr.
Listen--
Robert--
What's his name?
Gentlemen--
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
Robert--
You're learning a cruel lesson.
He's kidding.
Dad!
How long can you stay?
It's okay to use the phone.
They took the espresso machine.
Can I talk to you a second?
Jerry--
I'm sorry, man.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
It's me, Robert Dean.
Was Zavitz in trouble?
You think there was a connection to--
What is it you want?
Well we'd sure like to help you.
What's your opinion?
What happened?
We'd have to--
He's arrogant and threatening.
30 minutes ago you said we had him.
What about--
Found him.
Yes?
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
Yes?
Now is that clear?
Thank you.
I can't sing.
Daskylus
How much did you pay?
Why did you follow me yesterday?
What is he saying?
Actually, you sing.
What's this?
You should come into the shelter.
What am I looking at?
This is not very good, is it?
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.
Do they know them?
Will you not come in?
I'm impressed you can sew.
When were you most happy?
What else?
Say you're sick.
I can still taste you.
This is - what is this?
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
This - what's it called?
Madox knows, I think.
I don't care to bargain.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
I just wanted you to know.
Why did you hold his collar?
Katharine!
Why did he bring you?
Please don't move me.
Why did you hate me?
You're wearing the thimble.
It's so cold.
Shall we be all right?
Do you promise?
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
Tell me about your garden.
A broken car?
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.
What kind of photographs?
Safe journey.
Have you seen Katharine?
Oops!
Good morning!
I'll be back as quick as I can.
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Why do they care about our maps?
I believe I'm rather late.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Had a letter from my wife.
Hey!
How are you?
No, I'll get you some tea.
David Caravaggio.
Is this you?
Why is there so much nose?
Well, you must know.
Go!
Buon' Giorno!
They're fresh.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
I could help you.
It's a week.
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
You have to protect yourself from sadness.
Where did you find that?
Well, then ask him his name!
Buon' giorno.
Hello.
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
Are you outside?
Is it you?
Thought you'd never wake up!
Irving Berlin.
Have a drink.
What?
Hana tells me you're leaving.
And did you never see Katharine?
The team is in mourning, darling.
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Darling, I just heard.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
Of course.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
What was all the banging?
Oh - I've found plums.
Are you asleep?
I should try and move your bed.
There's a man downstairs.
Excuse me -
This is Captain McGann.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
Could I ask you to move?
I'll probably marry him.
Good morning.
Arguing about books.
You like him, don't you?
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
I'm still here.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
Where's your Stuart from?
Excuse me.
Try this.
For my hair?
I'll get another tin.
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
Why would anyone do this?
What is this business with you and explosives?
Don't go.
Kip - come and dance with me
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday!
What are you up to?
This is hot!
Will you come with me?
I've clung to you.
I'll always go back to that church.
The war's over - you told me yourself.
It's not safe here.
Why Picton?
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
He's gone, hasn't he?
Hello.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
Whoa - give me a chance!
I've got a surprise.
You've got a mustache.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
What's happening?  Am I needed?
Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almsy looks uncomfortable.
Mrs.
Darling, Peter says I could stay
Certainly not.
Katharine!
You should sit down, darling.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
This is wonderful!
Kip?
They're excited!
What about your rank or serial number?
Am I being interrogated?
Where were you?
You didn't answer the beeper either.
So he popped the pane?
That's great if you're a computer.
You ordering chop suey again?
Meaning--
And the draft blew over the flowers.
Mac's signature.
We've got to catch him in the act.
I've been following this guy for years.
That's doable.
You don't call, you don't write.
Gin? Where the hell are you?
I have a question...
Why are we speaking Chinese?
How about if I try humility.
Mr. MacDougal.
You have a car?
Seems I am.
You disappeared.
I don't care about the damned car.
Yes.
I've got something...
You're not taking me seriously.
I didn't expect you to be so...
Do you mind?
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
I've got something for you.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
For God's sake.
The Empress Death Mask.
I know.
But Roki said--
We going somewhere?
Very nice.
You want me to pick up a painting?
It's a test.
Fine. What do I do?
How much am I paying?
It's a fake.
I'm telling you it's a forgery.
A film case.
He says they turned the card down.
What the hell do I do now?
What the hell was that?
Motorcycle.
It's one way.
We're going to die, aren't we...
What about your bags?
Those are my clothes.
You stole my luggage? You--
That's entrapment.
I don't believe this.
Lose something?
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
You're late.
And good morning.
I know it well.
Only a week?
We?
I go in alone.
Pack up.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
Someone was expecting that.
I'll need that.
On what? Another job?
Why don't we take oxygen?
Let's do it again.
Did I hear a car?
I didn't mean to get personal.
So how long to pop the floor?
Got it.
That's it. We're ready.
I trust it's your size.
You bought this for me?
Thank you.
No, no, I want to.
Won't take any time.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
Aren't we early?
To us. To the Mask.
You're nervous again.
He wasn't.
And--
Camera in the--
We're working.
One, two, three...
Don't turn.
Ready?
Can you see the other PIRs?
They moved it.
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
Careful...careful.
We did it.
You're playing both sides of the street.
Okay, you're a thief.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
What?
Your share.
We're living history here.
I like banks.
Hmmm...44 long.
You've got everything planned.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
The Mask. Where is it?
Do you know what you've done!
Oh my god, I thought--
What about the rules?
Well...What are we doing?
What's that?
Peoples China Bank.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
Got it.
So how long till we do this?
You can't be serious.
How do I look?
Pulse detectors.
Done.
No way to take another day or two?
You shouldn't have.
You have something in mind?
That was a lifetime ago.
But would you--would you--
Of course not.
Not for me.
I'm going to disappear.
The sign of our partnership.
Jesus God, it's going through.
Relax, don't jam it...
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
The door's the only way out!
Jesus.
Come on.
Hang on.
I cannot get rid of you.
Put this on!
What's wrong.
You have the right to remain silent.
--You're a cop.
He looks familiar.
They've been on to you all along.
A true master.
Right.
Oh, it is.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
You two make quite a couple.
Oh, look at me, darling.
Tonight your league night?
Doesn't look like much.
This is just show and tell.
You'll just have to have faith.
Thirty-five next generation microchips.
Take this mask.
My friend, you always surprise me.
See you.
Anna?
Where've you been?
Um, Erin?
250,000?
A million things could have caused those problems.
Tony Marvin.
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
Whoa.  Remind me.
What the hell is this doing here?
What's she doing here?
Fax these to this number, okay?
Seventeen thousand in debt.
So.
What?
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
Hi.  Donna Irving?
This is a real nice place you got here.
Thank you.
I know.
Are you kidding?
What's chromium?
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
No.
It's a good day.  I feel good.
The judge came up with a number.
Oh, my God.
I can put them in a good school.
Open and shut?
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
I'm sorry, Erin.
You never called me back.  I left messages.
I never lied.
Okay, look.
Yeah?
All I have is hundreds.
You're a girl.
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
What are you doing here?
So what's the story on this thing?
I want a raise.
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
This is the only thing you found?
At least they made an offer.
Boy, do I know how you feel.
Then I don't get anything either.
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
Okay, so here's what I'll do.
And this shit is bad news, Mr.
We can get these people.
How many families we talking about here?
This is a whole different ball game, Erin.
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
What now?
Is that what I think it is?
You wanna talk about --
They covered 'em over.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.
Don't give me that.
Then they didn't know.
I like this case.
Hey.  I like working with you.
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
Hey.
Someone's following me.
What kind of truck?
I want my fucking money --
Oh, Jesus.
I'll see what I can do.
What kind of things come up?
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
What's a demur?
Counts?
Why good?
She insulted me!
Look, this is serious now.
How dare you take that away from me.
Don't give me that.
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
Morning!
Ho - ly - shit.
I don't know what to say.
What is that?
Two million dollars?
When'd they file the demur?
How many counts?
Who's the judge?
I've also been thinking about the team.
And you were told to destroy those?
Erin.
Pattee?  That your middle name?
You know what, Erin?
Hey, Ross.
What kind of chromium is it?
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
Mommy, can I get a flower?
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
Yeah.  A real moron.
Look, I know you're mad.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
You've been reading for hours.
What's going on in there?
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
Yeah.
Can I play roller hockey?
Randy's mom said yes right away.
God damn it, Matthew.
She's one of the sick people?
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Hey -- those are my files --
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?
Annabelle Daniels.
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
You want my number?
No.
I had a good neighbor, George.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
You're around every afternoon?
What're you doing?
What are you doing here?
Great.
What kind of person lives like this?
You're not nothing, Erin.
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
That's Ed.
Fuck you.
What's going on?  What are you doing?
About this.
You already packed up your stuff?
They said that'd be tomorrow.
Thank you.
Hello?
They up?
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
And I miss you.
Think you could learn?
You shouldn't be driving around, you know.
What time is it?
No, I need my car --
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
I'm embarrassed.
Someone stole my stuff.
Where's my paycheck?
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
There's something else, too.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
Hi, sweetie.
It'll be fine, yeah.
Dr. Paulsen?
Oh.  Oh.
Uh-huh.
It was .... the Emperor ....
My lord.
He will learn patience.
He can do it.
He'll learn.
Will he finish what he begins?
Stopped they must be.
Told you, I did.
I can't ...
You must survive, Luke.
... Luke, you must not go.
Will you?
How you doing, Chewbacca?
Barks at the mention of food.
Barks a blue streak.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Howls.
Well, it's been awhile.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
Barks at Han.
Barks his concern.
Barks a doleful farewell.
Barks at his master.
We should have stayed and finished them off.
I don't care.
... the power?
Barks his consternation.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
... Like we're being watched.
I'm looking for someone.
Give me that!
I don't want your help.
Mine, mine.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Yes sir!
What is thy bidding, My Master?
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
That's right.
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly.
Captain Solo, sir.
I don't know, Artoo.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
Sir, I was wondering ...
I think we're in trouble.
What are you so grouchy about?
You, too, golden rod.
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
We're doomed.
Yes, Your Highness?
Am I?
I don't know what he's talking about.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
That was no laser blast .
Asteroids!
There, there.
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
That was no earthquake.
They're moving away.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Stop that.
What are you afraid of?
Don't count on it.
There's something out there!
Are you crazy!
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Sharp bank, Chewie.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.
I don't like this.
What are you staring at?
He found him in a junk pile ...
No thanks.
I was worried about you.
... I love you.
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
Probe?  What probe?
About what?
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
That ship saved my life a few times.
How's your mining operation going?
Sorry friend, I had no choice.
Get out of here, Lando!
All this just to get the kid?
Don't shoot!
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.
I'll take what's mine now.
Hello!
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
It's a lovely outpost.
What about Han?
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
What's going on?
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
Chewie's right.
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
We've got to find Luke.
What'd you say?
No argument, just do it.
Someone's falling.
The deflector shields are gone.
I'm sure my men fixed it.
Nothing more can be done tonight.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
You rest now.
Closer?!
A tremor!
What??
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Artoo, you did it!
The Bacta are growing well.
Where are you going?
Calm down, will ya?
Leia!
Lando, is he alright?
This hyperdrive had better work.
Ready are you?
I have followed my feelings.
I will not fail you.
I can't. It's too big.
I don't believe it.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
No, no.
Price?  What do you mean?
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
I feel cold.
Ben?  Ben?
Will they die?
They're my friends.
Yes, yes.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
The fear does not reach you.
Your future lies with us, Skywalker.
All too easy.
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.
There is no escape.
The Hoth System?
Yes, My Lord.
Did you call the Zoo?
Excuse me.
So am I.
Do you have a name?
Nobody's going to believe it.
Zira, are you mad?
To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
What, Lewis?
What are they doing here?
Go easy, Stevie.
We shall want a full autopsy ...
But he isn't us.
I mean he's of your race.
Primitive?
May I say something personal?
ComStat did a psychosearch on him.
L.
His reactor's starting to overheat.
You were injected with glucose.
Who's that?
He doesn't look like his picture.
Ooww!
Cuervo...?
Come on, Cuervo.
Where is he?
Give it to me.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo.
Oh Cuervo...
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
Why should we leave?
Shit.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
I need a favor.
Wait a minute.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
I'm already dead.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
See you in hell, Snake.
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
I think we've burned off enough fuel.
How you doin' Plissken?
Shut up, Plissken.
Get this crap out of me.
I'll need to know more about this thing.
Where do I put ashore?
She's in the green.
75% power.
Plissken...?
Plissken - this is Malloy.
Got a smoke?
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Getting ready to invade.
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr.
Relax, war hero.
Where are they?
Location.
Stop the damn car.
Where is it?
Where are they going?
Not yet.
Listen up.
How do you know all this?
Me too?
Aw, come on, Snake.
I don't know about this thing.
I got an idea, Snake.
Is that what I think it is?
What're you doing in here?
Say, you need anything, Snake?
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake.
Hi, Snake.
What are they?
Don't follow me.
This is a dead end.
Be careful of the bald cats.
How do we get out of here?
Snake - what is it?
Why don't you get out of L.A.?
I changed my mind.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Run, Snake...They're coming.
Get ready, shitheads.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
You owe me.
All of us?
Is he coming?
My King, I couldn't do it.
Good day to you, sir.
Yield. I have the advantage.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you.
Thanks to God, you are alive.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom.
My domain is here, inside this metal skin.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
These men repented before God for their evil deeds.
Your deeds set an example for all other knights.
They miss the battlefield.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
Arthur.
At last...
Perceval, you have returned!
Merlin, will I live...?
He can be no other.
Who is Merlin?
Whose son am I?
You saved me from the arrow...
Merlin, help me.
How? Where?
A king must marry, after all.
I love her.
Who will it be?
I should have left you to fend for yourself.
So you were stealing their honey.
Excalibur! Is it true?
The knights of Galys approach the camp.
At your service, sir.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Merlin, tell me.
Yes.
What?
I am alone and betrayed.
I must do it myself.
Quiet.
But, I'm here.
Father...
I left it in the tent, sir.
Sir.
Who is, then?
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
But I have to leave tomorrow.
I will ride with Sir Kay.
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
Why can't you be my champion?
Who does it serve?
The law forbids it.
There are things about love--
Why didn't he kill us?
Just a man.
Very well. Climb up.
I have found you.
You left your husband's side?
No, no, of course not.
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
You know what I want.
They do.
You are truly magnificent!
What do you want?
You provoke me, Merlin.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
It's done.
I should butcher all and every one of them.
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
Now you must pay me.
The oath. You didn't say--
What honey?
Well, he does know the background.
You're convinced that it's genuine.
Hello?
Hi
Here.
Hello?
What did the doctor say?
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
This was under Regan's pillow.
Where do you want this?
I'm gonna miss you.
Strange.
Would you like some more coffee?
Oh, she'd love it.
I lied.
Thank you.
Good morning Madame.
But it's clean?
No. No rats.
There is nothing.
Bastard! I will kill you.
Karl?
Excuse me Miss?
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
Morning.
Is it coming out Willie?
A disorder of the nerves.
Now this is for Ritalin.
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up.
So, what causes this?
She's heavily sedated.
We still think the temporal lobe...
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
Chris MacNeil?
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
Thanks.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
Wanna drink.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Where's Regan's father?
She...killed Burke Dennings.
Yes. He's already here.
Is she gonna die?
What did you do today?
Well, not while we're in Washington.
Oh look at that.
Hey, where'd this come from?
You've been playing with it?
Wait a minute you need two.
You really don't want me to play huh?
Regan, why are you reading that?
Yeah
I love you Rags.
People get tired.
What are you doing here?
Oh my God!
I don't want it.
Mother please!
All done.
Hi Chris. Great party.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Goodbye Father. I call you.
Think you can sleep?
Goodnight Dims.
Lieutenant?
Do you like films?
Hello Regan.
You'd like that?
Did you do that?
Do it again.
You speak Latin?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
What's that?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti!
I am no one!
I am no one!
I'm all right.
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
Is that too tight?
Dimmy, you worry for something?
No.
Hallowed be thy name.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
And let my cry come unto thee.
...and to redeem through your son.
Father Karras?
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
See the cross of the Lord.
Amen.
Shut up!!
Why this girl it makes no sense?
What is it?
You're not my mother!!!
Have we met?
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
Hey, Father? You like movies?
MERRIN!!!!!!!
Stick your cock up her ass!
I cast you out!
...look down in pity...
Miss?
Are you comfortable Regan?
No.
Give me the keys.
Frankie.
What's this?
What're you saying, Charlie?
Trunks?
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Well, look at this.
Honey ...
Beasley.
They gotta go.
What do you do to him?
You the magician?
Piano.
Knee.
Oh my God ...
Oh no!
Oh, look at you two.
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
What's the gig?
Tag 'em, Willie.
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
What's wrong with it?
Don't make trouble, all right?
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
Count it.
So we on tomorrow night?
What d'ya got?,
What d'ya got?
What do you think?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
So what'd we get her?
I made her nervous.
What's with Charlie?
Yeah?
So you'll come out, right?
Jack.
Nice, huh?
A gust of wind killed him.
Look, can we forget last night?
Sure, why not.
What's that?
Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
Jack.
What are you, crazy?
How many other silent partners are there, Frank?
What's the matter?
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
Where the hell is she?
Awe inspiring.
You hit me.
All right, all right.
No.
See anything?
Oh, brother.
Make it collect.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother.
Something, huh?  All those bids.
You all right?
Hey, Frank.
Yeah.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow?
November.  '71.
I thought we had separate rooms.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
He's drunk.
Have some more wine, Frank.
You leaving that on?
Accommodate?
Thank you, thank you.
What's the matter with you?
What the hell are you doing?
How's it coming?
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
Funny, huh?
What're you trying to do?
You saw wrong.
What're you doing down here?
Expensive hangover.
The Royal.
They were simple songs.
That takes care of this week.
What're you doing?
We're not getting paid then.
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
Jack, you're on television.
What-are you?
What's happening to you, Frank?
Stay off it.
Jack!
I didn't hear you come in.
Uh, we already boxed some things.
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Go ahead.
Hey, what do you know.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
How're your hands?
Charlie called.
You sure?
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Sick?  How sick?
Actually, that's my stage name.
Uh... he knows it.
Oh, sorry.
This where the auditions are?
You're an hour and a half late.
This is show business?
I don't believe it.
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
Hey, it's legit.
So?
When?
Ready?
What's the problem?
Christ, look at her.
Come on.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Hey, pal.
What do you think?
Shoes?
They're tight.
We need scissors over here!
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Fucking.
Fucking.
Jack, you with us?
I guess it's,the Plaza then.
Maybe it's legit.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Well, well.
You two could play checkers.
You play all these places?
He's right.
Go ahead.
I don't believe it.
And how about this air?
Hey, we're connected.
You're kidding me.
What'd she sing?
Hey, will you look at that?
Oh yeah?
What's with you two?
What's with you guys?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
Some discussion.
I guess I ... If I jumped to...
How about you?
I can't sing it anymore.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Yes, sir.
Whatcha doin' over there?
Funny hours.
Brought it.
No.
Don't worry about it.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
You should've brought a leash, Mr.
You want to know if he's okay.
No.
It went well tonight.
You miss him, don't you?
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
You never sang before?
Fucking.
The Park?
Where's egghead?
He takes after our mother.
Uh-uh.
Mmm.
No.
He do that every year?
Oh, sorry.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
How do you do it? Every night?
I can keep the beat.
What's the matter?
Nina?
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
Like diamonds, huh?
You know, I saw you guys once.
History.
The both of them?  In there?
I don't know.
Frank said ---
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
You can always get another girl.
Saw the sign outside.
What kind?
Listen... you want to get a drink?
Tell egghead I said hi.
Jack.
Let me get the light.
Sneak out in the morning.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Guess they're up.
Ivory.
Hey, what do you want to do?
I tried Cheerios this morning.
How'd the show go?
From Hurley's?
Jack.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
There were more flowers last year.
John.  It's good to see you.
So. How are you?
Big piece or little?
How's that dog of yours?
Waxy Wright.
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
What did he do?
Fine work, Jon.
He's lying.
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Where am I?
Perfect fit.
Nice-looking kid.
And this thing can grow it?
Hey, bro ...
Pollux ...
So?
What do you mean?
I was in a coma, Pollux.
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
That's not the worst part.
Thanks, Pollux.
Well, you tried.
... I was dreaming ...
What are you saying?
Is someone there?
Who is this?
How did he expect to do that?
I took it from my fake husband.
Christ, Jon!
You can't go.
How is he?
How's Loomis?
Which ear was it?
Jon, this is goddam insane.
Now what?
This is it, Jon.
What's it to you?
-- Castor?
You killed them?
What are you going to do!
Stay away from my family!
What -- what are you doing?
I don't know.
Give up, Castor.
Jamie ...
They're too tight.
You'll what?
You better be nice, Castor.
SFPD?
We've got him sighted.
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.
Screw your boundaries, Janie.
Clarissa left those here.
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.
What are you -- stupid?
There's my little darling.
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
You've got someone in your office.
What happened?
Commander, what are you doing here?
You merciless bastard!
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
What about me?
You'd have to start immediately.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
What is with you tonight?
-- what?
You're wearing your suit --
What's on your mind?
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Where's Jamie?
I'll deal with her later.
I'm going to the powder room.
Remember this from our junior prom?
You too?
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Kate Reynolds...
Her assistant?
No...
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.
Hello?
Sorry, Jack.
You're right, Jack.
Mr. Mintz.
You have kids, Jack?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
And I know people.
Take you, for instance...
...thats our war room.
Good for you.
Jack, are you okay?
Excuse me?
No.
Rise...and...shine...!
Were almost done here...
Fightings a part of it, Annie.
This isnt my real life.
They did a pretty good job.
Do you like kids?
This is day care.
Where do I go now?
Not bad.
Maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall.
Very nice. What is it?
What are you doing?
Is it morning yet?
Were friends, arent we?
Im having kind of a bad day.
What am I saying?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.
Damn...
Wheres your follow through?  Wheres your stance?
Hey Jack, youre all flush.
Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class.
Hey, you cant park that thing here.
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Wheres my car?!  Wheres my Ferrari!?
Got a minute, Jack?
Cmon Jack...
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
Like I said, it's a business deal...
How'd you know my name was Jack?
Okay, Jack.
Yeah?  What do you need?
Miss me, Jack?
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
Do I look like I need your money.
Thats it?
Whats this, a signal?
But what do I do?
You cant do this.
Ive got kids, Im going home...
What!?  Look at the ticket...!
You leave now.
Like the dress...?
Finger food...?
Mushroom puffs arent the only thing I do well...
Evelyn, right?
Are we...?
Are we finally being honest?
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
Sorry, pal.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Dont  go, Jack...
Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
I can't seem to let go of you...
Are you okay?
What kind of man does that!?
Where were you?
What are you doing?
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Yes, Im fine.
Jack...
Here you go...
Hello!
Uh...that babys crying...
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Hey!  I was watching that!
Wait a second.
Shouldnt we grab some dinner first?
Thanks, Jack...
How can you do that?
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
$2,400?
No?
Look, Im sorry.
Well...Annie for one.
Our life in a nutshell...
How was the game, honey?
You mean this chocolate cake?
Cmon.
You want the cake!?
Thank you...
Say it, Jack...
Not it...?
Jack.
Maybe I should wait...
I found it at an outlet store.
You really are incredible...
Heres the thing.
You actually forgot our anniversary.
Jack...can we afford all this?
I need to tell you something.
Now Im worried.
I never used to be like this, Kate.
Good things...
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
Youre so...beautiful...
I could stay here forever...
Pretty incredible, isnt it?
So whats the big surprise?
This place is a perk, Kate.
Are you out of your mind?
I can do that.
Dont do that...
Its been interesting, thats for sure.
I need you to remember me, Kate.
I promise, Jack...
Kate...
You look great.
I'm sorry...
Whats going on?
Youre moving...
You cant go!
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...
Mrs. Peterson.
No...
Peter.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.
Peter Lassiter...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
Can I help you?
Damn...damn...damn...
Hey, my wifes in the kitchen.
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
I want to see you again.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
Don't you have anywhere to go?
Thats totally see through...
Ill go for a cup of coffee!
I found it!
How'd you know it was me?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Those yours too?
I can't take this.
What about his first born?
Can't do it.
They crashed it into a wall.
The shields on the station should protect us.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
How long was I out?
I don't know.
What?
Are you alright?
What the --!
We had a tough year.
You got a chisel round here?
Okay.
It's about to be a broken face.
Ben --
What the hell you smiling at?
Where...where am I?
What's wrong with me?
Hey!
The machine works.
No more cracks about how I look.
I'll be watching over you.
Deb.
Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
Ben, come in.
What do you want, Vic?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
Way to not overthink it.
I can handle the ship.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben.
You look like an eighties rock band.
He didn't.
He didn't mean it.
<u>Where is Reed</u>?
What?
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
Victor's right.
He's not responsive --
Oh, you dawg you.
This is wrong in so many ways.
Twenty?
Back it down, Johnny!
Is there something about flames?
He's right.
That's what I'm trying to calculate.
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
And where do we think we're going?
You're hot!
Me like-y.
You're on fire!
Apparently I can disappear.
Flame on, flame off.
Stop it.
Wait.
You're really cramping my style here.
I'm driving.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.
You two need a time-out.
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
Johnny, slow down.
What are you doing --
They're ready for you, sir.
Our numbers are through the roof.
Leonard, how's the feed?
How's the IPO?
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Got it.
Come on, Ben, come on...
Not until Ben is back inside!
Just a little banged up.
What are you doing here?
But I'm not done with the machine --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.
Feeling better?
For science.
Uh, Sue...?
It has to be the cloud.
What?
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
It's not "invisibility" per se.
Reed.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
What are you doing?
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Remember our first date here...?
I can...make it work.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
It's just business.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
What are you doing?
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, your scar --
You said it was urgent.
Victor, wait, slow down a second.
He's working round the clock.
Please don't make this personal --
'Scuse me.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission.
Benes' natural defenses.
Where do we stand?
Okay to proceed.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
But we have no choice!
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
What is it?
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
Benes... What the devil happened?
-- and why we need you.
Duval.
Wish I knew why.
Right, sir.
His technician okay?
I don't mean to be inquisitive.
General, I've heard some wild ones.
I assume Benes knows how to control it.
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by.
Just one, General...
Oh yes, great.
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
Yes, Alan.
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
I'll be standing by.
Listen...the Heart.
But we just can't leave him in there!
That's beside the point now.
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
Doctor...
What is it?  Anything wrong?
Never saw <that>.
Doctor...you can't mean that!
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
He's making a fine recovery.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
Look at that...they're changing color...
Then how come it worked loose?
Shouldn't you answer that?
You must carry spare parts --
Open it! Open it before they get here!
No need to get up --
Thank you for saving my life.
Such as?
That's why you're really here.
We better get back to the sub.
Doctor, what's wrong?
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
But that isn't possible.
We can't take a second more.
Nothing miraculous about it.
What can we do?
It's against my better Judgment...
The Soul?
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
Only to the naked eye.
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
How does it look, Doctor?
Doctor, we've just about had it.
The ship's good as finished.
You said there was a quick way out!
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
About forty miles an hour.
A what?
That's just dandy.
Tell them to take us out.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
There it is!
At this size, I would certainly think so.
In a way -- yes.
Well, sir?
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
Sabotage? I don't understand...
We're entering the Lymphatic System.
Looks like somebody declared war.
They're tracking us Topside.
Looks like quite a way to go...
Hold it, Skipper.
I'm in charge of this mission!
I don't believe that.
May I?
What'd you do that for?
Atomic fuel?
All in all, quite a canoe...
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Any reserve air?
What happened?
Come on -- it's no use!
Who, me?
What is it, Skipper?
Yes, there is.
What's wrong, Skipper?
How's it look?
That's it...
I'll never find my way through that.
Well, that takes care of the valve.
It's a dangerous procedure.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
Who the fuck are you?
...Is this a fucking joke?
This is a new car, then, sir?
Just in town on business.
... What is he, deaf?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
...Come on, man.
...Look at that.
Unguent.
You'll take care of it.
Clear him off the road.
She started shrieking, you know.
...You c'n'ave my truck.
One of us pays the other for half.
...So I guess that's it, then.
...Who's Jean?
...Blood has been shed.
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
I thought you'd never ask.
Both of these.
How ya doin'?
Hiya, Norm.
Where you girls from?
LeSeure.
He was a little older.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
...What's the big deal?
Good to see ya again, Jerry.
Okay.
Wade's got a point there.
...Yah, okay...
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
Mr. Lundegaard?
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
...Mr. Lundegaard?

Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Hon? Got the growshries.
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Jerry Lundegaard.
Yah!

Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
...Dad?
Are you calling Stan?
Yah, pretty good.
How ya doin', Wade?
Stan and I're okay.
What the heck were you thinkin'?
You're darned tootin'!
Dammit!
All the more reason!
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Hiya, Lou.
Yah, thanks a bunch.
Where is everybody?
Ya see something down there, Chief?
...Well, that passed.
There's two of 'em, Lou!
How's it look, Marge?
Somebody shut his lights.
You look in his citation book?
...Geez.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
...You can sleep, hon.
I'll fix ya some eggs.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah, yah, course I remember.
Geez! You look great!
...What can I get ya?
...This is a nice place.
...I was married to Linda Cooksey -
Better times.
Nope.
Hello?
...Hello?
His wife.
And this guy is...
Whose car?
...Chief Gunderson?
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Hon?
Yah.
...How's the paintin' goin'?
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
They announced it?
...So?
It's just the three cent.
I love you, Margie.
Uh-huh.
This is do-able.
I'm tellin' ya.
That wouldn't interest you.
What... ?
Get your hands off him!
I need to know where Tyler is.
You are a moron.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.
Cornelius!  How are you?
No.  I found something new.
That's a fucking great, man!
Is that your blood?
We need to talk.
Let's pretend.
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.
The dynamite...
No.
No, you can't die of insomnia.
I'm in pain.
We need to talk.
And I saw you practicing this...
Why are you doing this?
I.
It becomes an addiction.
We'll split up the week.
I'll take the parasites.
That's your favorite, too?
Looks like this is goodbye.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
Where have you been the last few weeks?
How did you find me?
What are you doing here?
It's time for you to leave.
What are you talking about?
This is a sweet side of you.
Where?  Here?
Make sure.
Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.
I think everything's okay here.
You... don't have to... leave.
I don't understand.
You hear that?
No.
What is this?  Who did this?
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Yeah?
Marla...
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
You got about thirty seconds.
Let go of me!
Leave me alone!
Tyler...
Why are you doing this?
I'm not paying this back.
What happened... ?
My God, you're shot...
Who did this to you?
Hello?
... and you come home to this.
How have you been?
You're the one who did this to me.
Throwers don't worry about ticking.
I had everything in that bag.
Tell the other person how you feel.
One minute.
It's getting exciting now.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.
This is how I met --
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
What do you do, Tyler?
You buy furniture.
I guess so.
Could be worse.
Insurance'll cover it.
They're called "cigarette burns."
One-forty-eighth of a second.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
I don't know about this.
Why not you?
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
How do you feel?
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
Oh, yeah.
Where's your car?
"I am Joe's Lungs.
What are you reading?
Unbelievable, huh?
You're sure?
You're okay with this?
She is a wild, twisted bitch.
What?
You want to finish her off?
Huh?
You get rid of her.
What is this place?
Stop it.
I.
Listen to me.
... Marla ... ?
No thanks, I quit.
What... ?
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove.
What are we doing?
Tyler...
I asked you what you studied.
I feel sick.
Hey.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Something on your mind?
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?
Is this a needlepoint club?
This does not belong to us.
What the hell ... ?!
I don't know!  Nothing!
I want to hear the truth.
What are you talking about?
This conversation...
You're too young.  Sorry.
"Too young?"
Four in Milwaukee.
He's not here!
Oh, yeah.
There!
No!
I wouldn't be doing that.
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
I'm pulling the green wire.
Yes...
I've got everything.
Bob was a grown man.
Tyler...
Ask me nicely.
One minute.
Can't you call it off... ?
What the fuck -- ?
Damn it!  God-damn it...
NO...
How'd you do that?
Why... why... why... ?
From now on, we'll share Marla.
What are you doing?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Do something for me.
Who is this?
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
His name is Robert Paulson!
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
He don't own this place, I do.
What are you doing?!
Raymond K.
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
S-S-Stuff.
Biology, mostly.
Animals.
Would you rather be dead?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
It's not just about me.
That's good.
The second one just dies.
You have to tell us now.
I was driving a white van.
Please, what else could it mean?
What about that?
What are you doing?
This makes no sense.
What did you see?
Another premonition?
What do you want me to do?
What did you see?
No!  It can't be.
A mortician.
Remember the onramp?
Here we go.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Jury duty?
Um, Clear?
I'm not sure I understand.
Calm down, Kimmy.
A Trans Am.
Look, you weren't there.
You've made your point.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
What?
Are you Jorge Cruz?
We had a fight.
This can't be happening.
Here's what I don't get.
I got that beat.
What's going on here?
Tell me again how it started.
Billboards about accidents.
You mean Alex Browning.
I tried calling last night but your father --
I know.
I didn't.
Pigeons... It's a sign!
Turn around.
Nora's not coming.
This is cheery.
New life defeats death?
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.
Shit, I don't have her number.
Whoa, nine months?
Guys, let's not panic.
Stop it, don't move him!
Um, Kimberly?
Kalarjian?
Shouldn't we pull over?
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
But it's over.
You can't cheat destiny.
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
Want me to drive?
This trip better be worth it.
What is it?  What are you?
What is it?  What are you?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
More than that.
Can I ask you a question?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid.
I'm sorry.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
What on Earth are they doing?
You're all certifiable, you know that?
Mom?
How would I know?
It's only the end of June.
You went there?
Not a likeness.
That's why I was there last night.
Is that something you're "feeling?"
This place?!
That... him?
Ahhh!
He said Death has a design.
How many died on Flight 180?
No.
Remember the departure time?
4:25.
Most kids do, I guess.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
I can't go home.
Billy told the F.
Stop the car!
Can't you open the door?!
Carter, get out!
Get out!
Police are coming.
You know what to do.
I'll remove him.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
We're losing our favorite teacher.
Is knowing going to make it easier?
What's your fuckin' worry?
You should have been next.
Fag.
Me, too.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
I'm.
Cuticle lacerations.
His father's pretty fucked up with denial.
... there are no accidents.
I'm sorry we broke in.
And don't pass on the right.
It broke!
What are you doing?
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
Knock it off!
Get control of yourself!
SHUT UP, BILLY!
You guys are real... aren't you?
You mean the snake?
Wow!
Your buddy made it out last night.
Hell.
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.
Ever do this from a jet?
Again.
Co Phuong Bao.
... to target at Ban Kia Na.
Gettin' old, huh?
No radio source.
Yeah.  Why not?
You read me, Brewer?
You okay?
What do you call that?
What's this?
Cocktail party.
That's it?
And a beat-to-shit AK?
This place is a trip.
You fucking crazy?
What's this stuff on the rice?
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
We'll check it out.
What's she saying?
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
How you doing, Brewer?
Snoring.
It's a guy in a cage.
Roundeye.
That guy's not going to make it.
I'm getting him out.
It's orders!
You better take off.
Are they going to torture us?
Gawd, you look awful.
Can you handle the door gun?
Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
You're gonna love it.
I'm Rambo.
You really got a Masters Degree?
How do we get upriver?
Where did you find this clown?
How did you get started working for the spooks?
Nguyen.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Are you okay?
Thanks.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Yes you can.
Look, Co...
What was that?
John.  My name is John.
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500.
Stay on your heading, Captain.
You pathetic scum.
I don't work with spooks.
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.
All this is for us?
He's giving them a run for their money.
Um.
How long have you been setting up?
How long before you're fully on line?
You think they'll find any?
What's up?
I know...
Take your time.
Look, it was a screw-up, alright?
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
You're out of your depth, Trautman.
Who're you?
What's your name?
Hello, John.
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
This your stuff?
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
Listen up.
Let's do it.
I like your nails.
Will it hurt?
My parents were divorced.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
Well, don't say it like that.
...My mother calls every week.
You know, let me tell you something!
Oh, no..I have to get home...
No really..I can't.
<u>You're surprised</u>!
Yep! Right on it!
Are you in a mood today baby?
Well, it's funny!
It happens to be a beautiful love story.
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you how distraught I was.
You were attacked.
... So... where did you sleep last night?
I'm not seeing anyone else.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
I tell you something, Anne.
Can I have my desk please.
I was not with a woman last night.
Hello....congratulations.
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
What are you two up to?
What do you think?
So what's going on?
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.
... What?
What?
You can't even give me that?
What have you been doing here!
Well!
Parry?
Yeah, I know the place.
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
Where you comin' from?!
You a friend of Parry's?
Can I help you?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Can you tell me something?
Um.
Remember. One chorus and out.
Isn't that awful?
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
.....Me neither.
Hello Lydia?
Yes.
Your name was picked.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
So how do we do this?
Now what?
You know, Anne does other people too.
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
Oh, Lydia!
Please don't hurt me?
I need a drink.
This is it.
Have I died?
Where am I?
... I've got a right to say something.
... Do you know who I am?
The Holy Grail?
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
I'm not married.
Do you follow her every day?
Why did you do that?
Here.
Here's another twenty.
That's O.K.
Well, I think you should be realistic.
But I gave it to you!
Pretty impressive huh?
...You are such a great guy.
Will you shut-up!!!
He knows who you are!
SAW WHO!!?
Parry...
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off.
It's such a great song.
.....What are you doing?
You can't do this!
..Ha...Little fella?
Are there any questions?
Holdin' my penis...
Will you stand still so I can do this!
Beautiful night huh?
You a fag too?
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
I advise you to let us go.
Come on!
Are you all right?
Parry Parry?
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
How do you know him?
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
Excuse me...
... It's not just from tonight.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
Well, id'n that nice.
You're not going to play it again.
Now quit, Bobby.
Cerveza.
Is it my turn again?
That was damn good, wad'n it?
Come on.
Come on, DiPesto.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
You like it?
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
What?
Just one minute, you!
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
Okay, Ray...
Rayette.
It's all right.
Bobby...
Come on.
Sure you don't want anything?
Look at my car!
What's your name?
How far are you going to?
You don't have to tell everybody about it.
I had to leave this place.
Well...
Hey, mack!
Fantastic!
Can I get you anything else?
No substitutions.
Wait, I've made up my mind.
I don't make the rules.
Wasn't it, ladies?
We been wantin' to ask you something.
Tea.
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Robert Eroica...
I just can't look at you.
You always do this to me.
Sorry.
Robert...
It's not funny.
Yeah... I guess so...
Well...  I better let you...
Maybe you better stay, then.
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
How long have you been staying here?
He has ways of communicating, Robert.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
What questions?
Why?
Oh no... Why?
Do you want some gingerbread?
Look at that.
I don't think I'd notice.
I think he's got a terrific personality.
Where is she, anyway?
It's none of your business!
I'm talking to you, Tita!
You're leaving?
Bye, now.
What have you been doing since then?
Hello...
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
I mean, how could you not play anymore?
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Is that funny?
Wait...
Catherine...
You think I'm a fake.
Yes, it was.
I don't find your language that charming.
Serious, that's what's important to you?
No, don't do that...
No inner feeling.
I married him when I was 17.
Robert?
Where are you going?
No, I want to talk to you now.
No, I can't...
No.
Four or five years.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
I hope you feel at home, Robert.
Robert, do you mind?
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
See?
That's three games to none, Carl.
Oh, for chrissakes...
Robert, I think you better just...
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
No, you're not.
What kind of doggy is that?
And what about love?
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
There'd never be a hole big enough.
Well...
Hey, follow that truck.
Salesmen and cops are the ones.
Mass production is what does it.
Miss Dupea.
Don't fuck wit' me!

You wanna do somethin' with me?
Where you know Amanda from?
Look.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
Maybe tonight?
Hey, what are you doing?
Fletch!
Hey you're really nuts.
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
You can't keep me here.
Can I call my Mom?
I hate the beach.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Greetings, everyone.
This one's going to be even more fun.
What the hell are you doing here?
I've got it all under control, Jerry.
Fat Sam left the beach today.
So where do you know Alan from?
Oh, I don't belong formally.
Did I say 'kidneys'?
So what do you figure?
Jesus.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis.
Are you all right, Doctor?
Here you are, Doctor.
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Cash. I'm impressed.
Good evening.
Read this, please.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.
He doesn't read my stuff well.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
And what was that?
I was already prepared to commit one murder.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
Regulations, Mr.
Velma.
Ten days ago?
Isn't that nice. Since when?
Has he?
He sighs.
I'm calling the police.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
John Ultramalensky, right?
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
I'm the Sufi.
Why are they after you?
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
We can't talk about it here.
I don't work for you yet, assface.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
I'm still here.
A .357.
Do you have a passport?
LAX.
Will you kill me?
Yo!
Did you hear something?
W-Y-K no 'c.
'Mr.
Thanks.
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout.
Did you say cops?
My hero.
I overheard it.
Cute young thing, too.
She's cute as a button.
John who?
Damn, I thought I had that one.
Why do you keep doing this?
Stay!
What's he doing in Utah?
Who is it?
Hi.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
I really should change.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
Lunch...
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
Thanks for the great time.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
Who.
So?
He told me he was dying of cancer.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me.
No.
What's wrong, Gail?
I've never lied to him before.
What is this....
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
I'm terrified.
Don't worry, I can take it.
I thought you had this all figured out.
Excuse me sir.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
You want I set up?
Your call is come through.
Excuse me.
The door was unlocked.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Where is she?
I spoke to her last week.
What did you want under the bed?
Fletch.
Two...
What's the spread on the game tonight?
Now, Irwin, try to follow me.
Just kidding, Frank.
What's 'practically'?
Gummy and two cops...
Just give me a hint, all right?
More cops.
How could you call him?
I'm quitting, Frank.
I'm out, Frank.
Fletch, you want an apology?
Yes?
You don't know the Underhills?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
But I ain't got you...
Sorry about the glass.
Oh, that!
Now that we've broken the ice...
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
Ouch.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man.
Damnit.
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
That was close...
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
So many assholes, so few bullets.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
Thanks for the promotion, man.
Your tip paid off.
You wish.
I do it for love.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
So what about this watch?
Quiet.
Tonight after I see Don.
Sorry, Jazz.
You going to be okay?
And it's good to see you, Julian.
Why did you interrupt?
How'd you get this from her?
I don't know, what was the case?
You okay?
Ah, an obvious choice.
Hello, Ford...
I came to warn you...
Aha, just what I suspected!
Your timing swallows the massive one.
What an interface!
Got those Vomit invites here...
Zuzu Petals!
A simple 'please' would suffice...
It's red, Ford.
Hello?
You okay?
Let's get serious...
You hung out with Bobby Vomit.
Spunk, come back...
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.
Yeah, it's weird.
Why are you depressed?
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
Zuzu, wake up...
My axe!
I know the feeling.
This is boring, guys.
Ford, you were right!
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Nice left you got there, jerk.
This way...
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
Pretty smooth, huh?
Ick.
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
I can't kill this kid's father...
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Are you okay?
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Hoh graphic!
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
Gut feeling.
When you going to let me work with you?
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Ouch.
This ain't no social call.
Holy Colonel Mustard.
I'm sorry...
I tried to help you...!
So, did you find my dad?
It's me.
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
What are you running from?
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.
It's some psycho killer groupie.
Polo.
Feel my thumb?
You were saying, snapperhead?
How's it going?
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?
Good to meet you, Mr.
I knew your father.  He was quite...
Terrible thing, but good career move.
Well, hello, Ford.
So what did you think of the ballet?
Jazz, we're talking here.
Uh, nice piano.
It doesn't have to be like this?
<u>Okay</u>!
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
Kill them.  Not quickly.
Shit.
You'd said something about proof...
I'm still the king!
You're that guy, the private eye.
Hi, private eye guy!
This isn't music!
I don't believe it.
How nice.
So...
What's my name?
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
How's everything?
Who knows?
Where are you?
What's your name, asshole?
I don't...
Henri c'est gentil d'tre venu.
Did you pick up the car?
Calm down -- Henri!
Allo... Salvatore...
Twelve o'clock... yes...
Everything's smooth.
Oh Alain!
Le sommes nous?
Are you sure it is dead?
Sale boulot.
I don't know.
There'll be someone else.
It's beautiful.
What's your story?
You're in show business.
I got no music!
There's nobody like that on six.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
Mr.
Where's he from?
That's in France.
What about you, Doyle?
What ya doin' out so late?
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Why don't you do the same, Doyle?
That's crazy.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
Who is that guy?
No, you?
Monica?  Who's Monica?
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
What the hell am I drivin' for?
Popeye.
Why not?
What happened to you?
You got the warrant?
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you?
You want the red or the white?
What about Sal?
My ass.
Timezit?
Same car.
Hey, Bo.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
No.
What am I, a shmuck?
So whatta you want a badge?
That was over thirty years ago.
Sexual assault, Daryl.
Oh, my God!
Why haven't they killed the juice?
How do we get to the vault door?
Oh, man.
Oh, yeah.
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
It looks open on the other side.
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
You okay, man?
Hey, bud.
How about a little of the King?
Damn.
What's the matter, Jules?
How was your tour?
Butch called.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
Frank...what's wrong?
Where's Johnny?
I love you, Bud.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I'm off.
There's something I gotta take care of.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere.
Hey, bud.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
Frank, we need to talk...
What is going on here, Satch?
What do you mean?
415 Greenwich St.
I swear, Satch.
Deleon.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
Okay, start pedaling.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
I'm scared.
You ready?
Yes!
Uh, hello?
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Where are you transmitting from?
Sorry 'bout that.
I'm right with you, man.
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.
Sorry 'bout that.
You call your son Little Chief?
Now you listen to me.
29 years...?
What the hell...
What's going on?
Oh my god.
That's impossible.
Dad...?
How could this be happening?
You sound...ground up...?
1998...?
It's really you, isn't it?
No, not yet.
You're still my Little Chief, right?
What's that?
What are you talking about?
But that's tomorrow.
Don't go.
Dad...?
Dad, you there?  You okay?
We're doing all right, Dad.
Right here, Chief.
When?
Murdered?  Why?
You ever talk to a victim's family?
What do I tell them?
I'll be damned.
Got it.
Tell me something good, Chief.
What else, John.
Hang on a sec, John.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
John, you still there?
He killed her John.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
I need you to believe in me.
I got it.
It's gonna work, Dad.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop?
What are you doing here, Satch?
Dad, what the hell is going on?
John, you there?
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
I'm not your uncle, kid.
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
Sull!  What the hell!
C'mon, man.
How you feeling?
John.  John, you all right?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Huh?
This is the Space Cowboy.
I better give you my address then.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.
You're not looking too good.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
This is getting real old, John.
She makes ten.
That's what we need here, Satch.
Our lucky break.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
I ran him through BCI.
Got a minute?
He ain't our guy, John.
Hi, this is Julia.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
I'm sure everything'll work out.
So how'd you like LION KING?
Hey, future boy.
Just came by to wrap up over there.
Wife around?
You used to be on the job?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
No kiddin'?
Huh.
Who are you?
Hell-
Who the fuck is this?
My name is Abel.
What is that?
Dammit Shelly!
No more... I can't!
Who brought up this bright idea?
You're all just jealous.
What're you gonna do?
Breakfast?
What was that?
Why don't we go take a swim?
What're you doing?
How about a roll in the hay?
How do we do it?
Think you can figure it out?
That was the best yet.
What're you doin'?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
Do you want a beer or not?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
I'm a slow eater.
It's dark down there.
Maybe we should do some exercise.
I can't find the bong anywhere.
What's the matter?!
Here.
Which one is it?
What are they saying?
Come on down!
What's this?
Derek... stop.
You know what I've been through.
You haven't changed a bit.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Shelly!  Where are you?!
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.
This is too painful to look at.
Why did you come back here?
What happened that night?
Could we move a little faster?
You know him?
Hi.
What d'ya got in there?
What are we gonna do?
Faster!  Eat faster!
That scarecrow?
Is... is everything all right?
Please... be cool.
Are they following us?
See anything?
I don't see anything.
Got any good ideas?
This is no time to celebrate!
What're you doing?
Bullseye!
You've just learned a valuable lesson.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
I thought that was the end of the song.
What?
Will you hurry up!
That's it.
Will you slow down?
Darren, we better turn around.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
That's right.
Oh, jeez.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Is that all you found?
You just sit tight, Jason.
....with a woman's touch.
Come on, you guys!
Ahh, nothing.
Once we nail Roy, that's it.
Never should've let her play.
Come on, Dad.
Jason who?
But, Dad, we...
What it is?
...And I said, shut up!
Rick.
No.  No, it's not...
Yeah, hi.
What?
You got it.
It's all over.
So what are ya drawin'?
There...Ya happy?
Okay, give it back.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
Are you sure this is gonna work?
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
So what happened?
You mean you had a bad dream.
...Good.
Where'd you get this?
You know what?
I can't believe no one called back.
But what if they try and scare us?
So where's Cort gone off to?
Okay, okay.
Hi.
I just realized something.
What's goin' on?
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.
Jason is alive.
No problem, Rick.
Why didn't you cremate him?!
I sympathize with you kids.
Yes!
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
Don't concern yourself, Martin.
With extreme car, for God's sake.
You got me where you want me.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Well, let's hope not!
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
...but there just may not be enough time.
Steven...
Anything else?
I know who you are.
No, I --
What do you want?
Everything going okay?
Steven buggin' you?
Ed...
I gotta get back to work.
What's the problem here?
Hello...
Jesus!
Listen.
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
Maybe you should be moving on.
You're talking about my lady.
Careful, Chief.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Why did you want her body?
Lock this asshole up.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.
She's beautiful.
Why didn't you tell me?
Does he know about what happened?
It was a community service.
What are you doing?
Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
Wanna know how I did that?
Well?
I'll be back later.
Oh, my dear God...
How many times do you want to hear this?
You call what you did bad?
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
That's disgusting.
Steven!
What's going on?
Have you seen Tamara?
It's my graduation gift from Daddy.
A major prick.
He's undefeated, you know that?
No thanks.
A real space cadet.
What are you going to do?
That was truly excellent.
Well...how do you feel?
What's wrong?
What murders?
Right.
Did you hear that?
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
But I thought...
Where's the radio?
Christ...where's Rennie??
What's that?
She never should've set foot on this ship.
Dear Christ...
Jason's here in New York.
All right.
What are you doing in here?
Where did you get that alcohol?
That's it.
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
You have no right...
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
I demand to know what is going on...
What are you doing??
Did you find Rennie?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
I doubt very much that one even exists.
What did you do with Rennie??
There must be a phone around here somewhere.
What a beautiful day.
I...I can't...
You're making a big mistake, Rennie.
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
You had me worried to death!
Can't we at least talk about it?
Get in the boat, Rennie!
You pushed me...
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
Everything okay?
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
So, are you having fun yet?
I can't swim.
When did this start?
Did you have an accident in the lake?
I've got the numbers.
Rennie...
I got you a present.
Can he really take us home?
I think so.
I didn't mean for you to go!
Rennie...??
Rule one, don't panic.
We'll be okay.
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
You have to call the police...
I used to drive a taxi.
I used to be head of neurosurgery.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil.
We must abandon.
We must abandon.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Guys ready to order?
Say it again.
Nicky.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
Very dangerous.
I'm trying to think.
Is it safe?
The man has taken over my mind.
Where are you going?
He carries a gun.
We're making too much of this.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
Shoot him.
Great game.
I think you're a little confused.
Of course I saw it.
This could be it.
This could Pbe it.
This could be it.
Last night.
I'm proud of this play.
I used to tell myself.
It makes me so mad.
I never see you anymore.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Because you refuse to believe she's serious.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Rogan, Laurel.
And you blame me.
Look.
What will we talk about?
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
Why won't you tell me your name?
I'm willing to tell you my name.
What else?
If you're wondering about the firearm.
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
See, Daddy.
Your father said you might be here.
I'll have whatever she's having.
Opening night, Lillian.
I am really, deeply sorry.
What's it like to shoot somebody?
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
Life is good.
People are dependable.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
It's Stanley.
This could be it!
Life is true.
Who is it?
What do you want?
Across Ninth Avenue.
We must have been heroic.
Remember 1949?
You'll need these.
`Why doesn't he come live with us?
I'm looking at you trying to think.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
Go on, tell him.
You're a family man, Frankie?
It's a complicated subject.
Your problem is you take the easy way out.
You made him strike out.
Say it and you'll believe it.
I don't know.
Don't worry. It's a test.
This could be it!
Then they lost?
They're my team, too.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
I had lunch with Joanna.
'm not worried about this kid.
I hate the Mets.
Have to hurry back.
Game six is history,pal.
What do you mean?
Yessiree, Bob.
Sidney remains optimistic.
And the Father replies?
This could be it.
What's good?
You've worked with Elliot?
You keep slipping away.
Do you think he can do it?
What? Come on, Paisley.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
You've come to me.
Yes.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
Just like proper English gentlemen.
Here, you see?
Oww!
Please! You're being foolish!
God gave you ten thumbs.
".
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
You really are going to Pakistan, then?
Enough.
Just an admirer...
You're a clergyman.
That was lucky.
No violence, please.
What are you doing?
Not quite.
They're calling you "Bapu.
...and I knew something had to give.
You mean Gandhi?
What'd he say?
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
What can we do?
And Jinnah?
What do you want?
You're an ambitious man.
It's beautiful.
Do you remember much of South Africa?
You've done me a great service.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
Are you going to walk all the way?
It has.
Do you find me stubborn?
The honor is ours.
You mean a general strike?
Who is that young man?
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
They are preparing for war.
We need your help!
Well, then, it must be fought.
They're sparing no one, I see.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Perhaps some tea?
Hm.
Good.
You're an extraordinary man.
Assuming we are in agreement?
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi.
Have you read his magazine?
He was right.
In Calcutta it's like civil war.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
You almost sound like you believe that.
Well?
How are you doing this, Vincent?
Vincent, where's the shore?
How much extra?
And don't go getting everybody lost out there.
According to this, he's a sick man.
We're in the wrong place.
--There's that word again.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant.
Of course.
He was afraid of being exposed.
You know their workforce.
That's the last.
What are you waiting for?
Positive saliva match.
How often do you test, Director?
We believe we have a suspect.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Twelve have a mission within the week.
At least it's nothing contagious.
Hello.
Good to see you're feeling better.
Don't be deceived, Irene.
You okay, Jerome?
What's wrong with it?
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
I have to know where you come from.
It needs work.
You really need that much?
It's not too late to back out.
What about you?
Who died?
That's not the point.
Let's get out of here.
I gotta stop!
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Call German.
What makes them think that?
Come on--we're taking off.
You really had other offers?
Not thirsty?
How was your evening?
Where are we going?
Where are you taking her?
Everybody goes there.
Hello?
How are you, Jerome?
I have your samples ready.
Why have you done this?
Thank you.
First, we may as well decide on gender.
Anything I've forgotten?
What will happen to the others?
What do you think?
Vincent...Vincent...
He has the heart of an ox.
Yeah.
You can wear lifts.
Hugo!  I've found him!
No bother.
Can that be, er, verified?
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
Have they found our friend?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
You didn't know?
I envy you, Jerome.
It's here.
Of course I think about it every day.
So you didn't do it after all.
Why are we leaving?
What about the car?
I can't.
What happened?
What is it?
--when you go away.
A year is a long time.
Jerome.
I've got enough here.
What's this, Lamar?
Flight got you nervous?
What are you doing?
The doctor will give you something.
--I've read your profile.
The name?  For the certificate.
You gotta be kidding.
All it takes is a long arm.
You're back with your own people now.
What about them?
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
Hello, McCoy.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
What about your wife?
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
I'm in a hurry.
A simple reason, McCoy.
We'll try again.
Hello, Doc.
You want to drive?
Feel good?
It doesn't look like that.
What's Beynon got set up?
Where did you get those?
Half a million.
How does it taste?
You been okay?
You go out much?
I guess I'm kind of...
Wait... give me a minute.
I'll be okay.
How was it?
I was going to fix you breakfast.
$250,000 right off the top.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
Why are you laughing?
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
Keep going over these.
You know how I feel?
Promise you won't laugh.
What about the bank?
Doc...
They checked in.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
Do you trust him?
Why didn't you tell me?
A man helped me open it...
How long ago.
There better be a guy with the
When we had trouble before it was different.
You've got it all figured.
There may be a hunting party.
What?
You're full of ifs.
Maybe.
That would be the first time.
You can't trust anything these days.
Only one car.
Where are you going?
How much?
Are you hungry?
Okay?
No scars?
We better stick here till tonight.
We're going to make it.
I want to say something.
I always thought jails make people hard.
Sounds good.
Okay.
What is it?
You're crazy.
Come on, come on.
You okay?
How long before this car's hot?
Are we going to make it?
What now?
That's right.
Where's home?
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
Hope you get to where you're going.
Can I help you?
You're out of touch.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
I'll hang on to these.
How's Mama and the kids?
Drive.
How was that?
Let's just get to the border.
Which way?
Well, I paid a hell of a price.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
You do what he says, Harold.
What's the damage?
I've got to stop.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
I didn't know who Doreen was.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
You knew what I'd do.
What do you want?
What about the brakes?
You know what the bloody time is!
I made a mistake.
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
A new venture of mine.
Five grand.
That's not good enough.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Jack?
Train goes at four minutes past twelve.
Who paid you to see me off?
No, don't Jack, don't.
Where's he living these days?
Can I go now?
Everyhing go off all right?
She's nothing to do with me.
Hold it!
Really.
How were things between you and Frank?
I don't believe you, Margaret.
It is. Honestly.
You know Sid Fletcher?
I know him too.
Yes. I met him last year.
We went about together.
How'd you know where I'd be?
Who's setting you up in this place?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
That's why you waited for me.
I want to give you an Oscar.
Now tell me the truth.
It's a bloody funny thing.
Let her go.
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
Sorry about your father.
How's school?
You all right now?
Where you going to live, then?
Good.
I couldn't believe it when I heard.
I mean, what for?
You work here, Keith?
How'd you know Albert?
What you having, Jack?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Said he'd heard you were up in town.
See you later.
Thorpey.
Ah, Edna, come in.
What happened to you, then?
Did they give you a rough time?
Stuff it!
I won't be using the room tonight.
Are you a traveller?
Ta.
What is it?
Inside?
And what you going to do?
Now just a minute...
You sod.
What'll they do to him?
They bloody hurt me.
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
So shut up.
Are you awake?
Did you sleep well?
Are you tired?
Do us a favour?
What you going to do?
You coming back?
Is he?
Thanks.
Well, well.
What's it to you anyway?
So you're doing all right then, Eric.
They're still the same.
Jack! I didn't like that.
You're finished, Jack.
Eh? Have a drink.
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Not going, Jack?
Put it away, Jack.
Gerald wants to see him first.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
Ask me?
Not suede boots!
What's that? A hundred?
What's that?
All right. Two hundred.
What's that?
Four hundred?
I'll see you, then.
How about that, Jack?
Polacks and deadbeats.
You had one you'd know it.
They did.
It's not.
And it's not right to the customers.
Shoes, boots, yes...
That's thinking.
That's what I'm saying.
To say "I'm going on my own.
...you're absolutely right.
Something.
Someone should rob the office.
What could somebody get for them?
How many leads have we got?
Yes.
No.
You didn't?
You're going to steal the leads?
Did I say that?
Yes.
A job with Graff.
Yes.
Me?
Yes.
Dave.
Oh, yes, George.
...you don't have to come in...
And why is that?
Can we get some coffee...?
Fine.
I, you know, they should be insured.
I can't close 'em.
It is dead.
What.
Were the leads...
He said we...
See...?
Will you excuse...
Did they...?
Did the leads come in yet?
Read it.
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
Who used to say that?
I don't know, George, why?
What?
Shelly: get in the office.
Mmm.
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Excuse me, fella.
Oh, fuck.
Who told you...?
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.
Aaronow...
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
You stupid fucking cunt.
Mr. Levene...?
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.
John.
Shelly...
What is this "you say"?
...it isn't you...?
Money.
I've seen those leads.
Why?
Of what?
I will close.
Alright.
What are we going to say?
Now?  Now?
I wish I could.
Wait.
Why?
You want to do business that way...?
Is that what you're saying?
What happened?
Ah, fuck.
How could I tell 'em your sale?
Would you?
Mmm.
You are?
How do you know I made it up?
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
It was his idea.
What?
What sales...?
The check's no good?
Don't.
You did that?
Those fuckin' deadbeats...
Give me some leads.
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
"You do get the..."  Huh?
I got 'em in the kitchen.
Rick.
Dave...
Get the chalk.
Eight units?
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
When?
They took the leads?
Just now.
Fuck you, Dave...
Fuck you care...?
How was it...?
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.
You closed 'em today?
And, and, and, I did it.
Oh, Christ.
Glad to meet you.
You're sure?
What?
Rick...?
Rick...?
Rick...
Ricky, I...
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.
Or a piss...?
Money?
I've got to talk to you.
I've got to talk to you...
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
Monday.
I don't know.
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
You don't count Saturday.
Today.
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.
What's going on here?
No, no.
I'm...
...what, what, say it.
The deal.
What?
What?
What are the police doing?
You cashed the check?
Fuckin' asshole.
Guess what the Machine did?
Fuck you.
You just this morning...
We haven't got a lead...
Bring that shit up.
Is that what I did?
I'll show you how to chew it.
They didn't get your contract.
They didn't get the contracts.
Listen to me: They got some of them.
They took some of the con...
Where are you going?
...you want to go out today...?
Patel?
Three?  I count two.
Yes.
We had a slight burglary last night.
...Mr. Williamson...
...I wouldn't worry about it.
Are you alright?
Did you see my present for you?
Mr.
I have a friend who has a fine rug.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
Who is the greatest man you can think of?
What took so long?
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
Constanzia.
How are you, honey?
The ink on your divorce isn't dry.
Is Kay coming?
I want to talk to you, Michael.
Honey!
Goddamn bitch.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
I don't want to stay here...
Would you like some?
Don Francesco.
Ten to one shot, you said.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?
Ready, Frankie.
Who's that?
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Oh, 'scuse me.
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
Fredo.  Where are you going?
I didn't know it was a hit.
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
I bet you can't guess what happened?
What did I tell you.
The 'patrone' is here.
It's Michael's request.
Where's my wife?
He doesn't want my help any more.
Hello?
What do you mean gone?
You're going to talk to him now.
Rocco!
She took a flight to San Francisco.
Me too, Tom?
If you need anything, just...
Mikey, I hoped...
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
Where's my brother?
Go on, tell me.
Was it a boy or a girl?
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
Sit down, Tom.
Fifteen percent skim?
It might show.
We've never sent this much with one courier.
What's up?
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
...and the tape will be running.
What the hell are you talking about?
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.
Senator Kane.
Yes.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
Kay.
How's the baby?
Leave her alone!
I had no idea...
Are you Klingman?
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
Sit down, this is almost over.
Nothing is more important.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
Enjoy.
This doubles my investment.
Hiya, Mr.
This is it!
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen.
I just left our friend in Miami.
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
I know.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.
They're still on the property.
We'll try.
On the phone?
Rosato, where's your brother?
He don't want to talk?
What's this?
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
Here is the six month's increase in advance.
I accept your generosity...
Thanks, doll.
What makes you say that?
This looks corny.
These old movies are such a hoot.
So what did you think?
You know what?
What's that mean?
The look on your face!
I like my life.
So you don't want to fuck.
Don't worry, you already paid me.
It's your job, lady, not mine.
Something I can do for you?
The Master is dressing.
No.
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
You ever been married, Hanna?
What is the good English?
That is why he must go to hell.
It's not what you think.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
What have you done with him?
I didn't do it.
You must leave.
Good morning.
Getting to be a warm day.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
Or would you prefer a beer?
These are your paintings?
You must excuse me for staring, Mr.
I apologize for going on like this.
All right then.
Did you see this?
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?
Dripping?
I'm sorry.
You have to excuse me, Mr.
How are you, Mr. Boone?
Do you mind?
Is this David's doing?
Saw your movie the other night.
Did you kill anyone?
Just a trim.
So you had a wife?
Does that surprise you?
So we understand each other?
Can I see what you did so far?
Oh dear.
Tell me more about yourself, Mr.
Is that why you and your friend split up?
After that, I went out of fashion.
But I chose freedom.
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.
The extras are in their places.
Mr.
I'm curious, Mr.
And the fear you showed at our last session?
This was World War I?
Barnett.
Just go.
My apologies.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
I suppose you'd like the top down.
What did I tell you?  Listen.
What was that about?
Who's that?
Is that really her?
Are you enjoying yourself?
Oh fuck.
Let's get out of this funk hole
It's not like her.
Oh, of course.
You're much wider than I am.
That only leaves the rest.
Is that --?
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back?
Tell me something, Clayton.
I never made it to Korea.
My old man was a Marine.
You know what he did when I called him?
Do you mind?
Storm's getting worse.
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling?
So it is going to happen after all.
No.  It won't do.
Why?
All right.  Let's take it off now.
Just take off the fucking mask!
I'm not that way.
Break my neck.
You okay?
I can undress myself, thank you.
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
I'm up.  Thanks.
I liked it.
You coming, Boone?
Hey, Boone.
Can't say that I have.
Calm down, Clay.
Sick stuff.
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
Where's Betty?
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
By the way, I like the Renoir.
What are you doing here?
Should you be drinking in your condition?
I didn't ask George to invite you.
You're a lucky man, Mr.
My God.
Uh-oh.
Jimmy.  How are you?
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
Is that Boris?
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Mr. Kay, sir.
Which ones?  I bring them all.
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy?
You remember what the doctor tells us.
He looks plenty big.
Oh, that monster.
He is not going to kill the old man?
She is horrible.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
Does the yardman come today?
Who was that at the door?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
It needs a hat.
That is my daughter.
Mr.
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
This is the studio where I paint.
So, Mr. Kay?
Yes?
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
I have a proposal, Mr.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
George Cukor?
Don't be shy.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Can that count as one question?
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
Oh my God.
I was going to take a swim.
Mr....Kay?
How are you?
Can we get together while I'm in town?
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
How's the leg?
What are you doing here?
What about?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
He took a job.
It seems she neglected to mention it
Who was the job for?
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
What's with the fish thing -- ?
I think about that night a lot...
Yeah -- ?
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
Now.
My point.
I can come up with the front money.
They gave you only four days?
I'm not interested --
Sound it out for me.
I don't want them hurt.
This is how you're spending my time?
Get out of here, Ray --
Well, well.
Well, now, he's clear.
Well, that certainly won't do.
Good.
They just brought in Donny Astricky.
Let's get out there.
I know you --
You have my word...
I know you.
And this has what to do with me?

Shit.
The answer's no.
Actually, I never rode Western.

Why didn't it work out?
I hear that!
Everything under control?
You missed a button.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Now, listen.
I won't apologize for this.
Show me again.
Summers are short here, Annie.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Then what have we been doing?
Liz is taking care of him.
Why don't you go lie down?
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
Oh, honey... What happened?
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
You want to take your bath?
No, I don't mean you have to.
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Would you like to see that?
This'll be nice.
How long is this going to go on?
Who do you think I'm doing this for?
You buckled up?  You cold?
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
He's still sitting in that damn field.
Did you ask him to come visit?
You got everything you need?
Honey, come on.
I'll come.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
Nothing.
Grace?
I don't deserve that.
What did you say?
Started what?
Who's going to want me now?
I'm sorry.
Who is it?
Let's bring your bags inside.
What's the matter, honey?
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
Great!
David?
Oh, come on!

I'm sorry about last night.
Okay. We'll see you later then.
What about Grace?
That bag's almost empty.
I'm sorry.
What did he say?
I should go get some of her things.
You can hardly get your arms around me.
You've got to stop doing that?
How was the dinner?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
What was I saying?
I don't understand.
No.
What if she doesn't want to go?
Yeah.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country?
I miss you, Annie.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Small bed.
You were right about coming here.
Yes?
Was the trip okay?
I have so much to tell you.
You know, that's interesting.
Nobody's using it.
It's so cruel.
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
Where does this go, Diane?
Mm-mm.
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
I'll help you with the coffee.
What?
Is there anything you need?
It's just one night.
Good luck to you, Annie.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Mixed salad.
They're already all settled in, Frank.
Play that sweet one you know.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
I believe so.
Ha...
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
When you figure on branding?
I don't believe it.
Tom?
Don't you go to school?
Why do you always wear that hat?
Would you let me ride your horse?
Yeah?
She gonna be long?
Isn't it like, obvious?
That's not a question, is it?
Can you drive?
I can't...
Put the key in and turn it.
Just follow this.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
Are you afraid of anything?
I can't... not yet...
Sure?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
It's warmer than I thought.
My parents are having friends from college over.
...Oh, come on!
"... and I said that"...
Jude, you okay?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
Do you want something else, honey?
You want to watch some television?
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
What, sweetheart?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
IT WAS MY TURN!
Don't be such a baby!

Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Hey, Laurie...
Are you coming over tonight?
Yes, I am.
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there.
I gotta go.
..."how now, cried Arthur.
Not any more.
Laurie...
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
Who is it?
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
Are you sure?
Laurie, you come with us...
Everybody has a good time tonight.
I'm scared!
Hello.
I'm not responsible, Sam.
He was your patient, Doctor.
Ever done anything like this before?
Pull up to the entrance!
What did he say?
...any sister talk?
Oh, good...
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
I love that.  That's my type.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
Hi.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
What are your favorite buildings, David?
That's just --
Yeah.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
Yeah.
I know.  It's terrible!
We're a big hit.
Wow, it's the red one?
Oh!
It's French, though.  It really is.
That's disgusting!
Oh, geez, yeah.
Well, I live downtown.
Uh...
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
I'm telling you, you sounded great.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.
Mm-hm.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
You're Holly.
Oh, what, what do you do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.
Oh, it's just so romantic.
It's really sad.
Yeah.
Oh, gee, I don't know.
We could...we could do that.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Now I ca-can't remember.
You've had some dizzy spells.
Now, don't get alarmed.
How ya doin', man?
What a weirdo that guy is!
Hi, Dusty.
Are you excited about becoming a collector?
You--  Standards and Practices?
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
We--
Oh, well, you know Frederick.
Really?
Like, uh...?
Yeah.
Oh, my goodness!
I'll never understand it.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
Oh, book?
No, no.
Yes.
Yeah.  How are you?
Fine.
e.
Well, thanks a lot.
Page a hundred and twelve.
How's everything?
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Isn't that beautiful?
Uh.
Elliot!  Don't!
Oh!
Elliot!
I was looking for you.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
I thought you weren't coming.
This is not an easy situation.
That was just perfect.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
It's over, Elliot.
But it hasn't been forever. 
And you're in love overnight?
Mm-hm?
They're fantastic.
She has all the cooking talent.
Great idea.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac.
You bet.
Where're you going?
Are you in a bad mood?
Yes.
Well, what?
I'm not accusing.
Well, what is it then?
Well, what do you do?
You matter to me.  Completely.
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
...this is a toast!
I am... I did slave all day.
I don't know about that.
Hi.  How's she doing?
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Hi, Mom.
I want ice!
Oh, Mom!
I don't understand.
Why should I be afraid?
Who thinks about such nonsense?
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.
Want some coffee or tea?
How about something to eat?
Are you sure?
God!
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Mmm  you never know.
Elliot lusts after you.
...or films you must see or... 
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
I don't sell my work by the yard!
What's the problem?
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
Like what?
Oh, Christ!
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
Look at this guy.
Oh, Jesus!
N-n-no, not that.
You don't have a brain tumor.
Eh, you were miserable this morning!
You're just realizing this now?
Yeah.  What?
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that.
Oh, great.
Oh, yeah?
Hi.  Where's Holly?
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
So how are you?
Oh, he's fine.
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
What's the matter?
Hi!  Hi!
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
How is everything?
Let me get a little reaction here.
Ohh!
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Gee.
This is the second opinion.
I'm so humiliated.
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child.
Hannah and I.
Hey!
Here, Mom.
No, Holly's game for anything.
What?  You're kidding!
Perfect!
Get outta here.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
Uh-huh.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Ohh?
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Don't you think she does?
Frederick didn't come with her.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Oh, Hannah!
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Ouch!
He's married...
Sometimes she's terrific...
Ohh!
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Nobody but you can do that to me.
Hey, hi!
Awwww...
Boy--
Oh, gosh.
Oh, God...
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Well, that-that's good.
Well, I don't know.
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
You treat me like a loser.
Not so!
You're crazy!  That's not true.
What's the matter with you, Lee?
Hey, what's the matter?
My script?
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Oh, why are you making those faces?
Don't, no, please.
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
Can we, can we go?
Thanks for a swell time.
I'd never do that.
So how are you?
You're okay, though, huh?
Really?
You must be joking.
No, you can tell me straight.
Oh, God!
Now don't get nervous.
Thanks.
Mickey?
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Yeah.
Dad...
Hi.
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
Oh, please!
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Why are you so upset?
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I can't think.
You know why that is?
Well.  Word gets around.
I asked you how you like your coffee...?
Bad beat today.
Evelda Drumgo.
C'mon, pal.
You want to get married...?
Then you tell me, then.
Hard up as you are, at your age?
How you doin?
Brigham.
What, What, I can't hear you...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?
How was America?
What else did I miss...?
Hold up a minute...
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
<u>Do</u> it...
Where was the call from.
...sir...?
He escaped...
What do you want me to do?
..It won't be long now, sir...
He don't like popcorn.
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Sir:
Why would you say that?
Look at this:
Yes sir, I saw it. 
I know you did what you could.
Just a moment.  Starling didn't...
Your girl's a menace.
Waal...
Waited too long, hon...?  
I said how's your baby...?
Give it up, Evelda.
Sadly, no.
My husband brought it to me from America.
Of course, Commendatore...
If your duty requires it.
Yes.  How did you know?
And?  Then?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Darling...
Who does not?
...long overdue.
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.
...Franklin.
In and out.
Make them eat the figurine.
And you let her get away.
...spend some time on the streets.
I came to pay my...
...may be the heat....
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
You look lovely.
...I'm sorry....?
Thank you, Cordell.
The girl could use some help.
...when I... 
You want another drink, honey...?
What's that, Baby?
Look what they put her on...
You should get Married.
What was it.  What was it, honey?
...what...?
No.
Give me your gun...
...my love...
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
"Because we don't have any money."
Ask me when we get home.
Hello....?
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
...<u>sadly</u>...
...this one is my favorite.
What're they on about?
...a Dr.
She must be something special After Dark.
Tell me why...?
Yes.
Ah, yes, ah yes.
My encounter.
...sir...?
Believe me, I wish I knew less.
Sadist!
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
Now what? What did I do this time?
Summer would have been a lot less without you.
Howdy Pouty.
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall.
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
There you are!
Man, she's losing it...
Talia, don't go!
Whew, that wasn't a period.
Freeze!  You're busted!
Mine!
Go stand by the flagpole.
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.
No, they're not from Wendy.
You're a little harsh on Todd.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
What are you doing?
You know you just do this for shock value.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
I'm sorry.
...sorry...
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS.
You look a like you could use a friend.
I have to get up.
Yes!
What in the hell did you do that for?
Hey.
Do you really not believe in God?
What else don't you believe in?
When were you in Niagara Falls?
Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance.
Fuck off.
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
God, you're beautiful.
Sorry Veronica.
Don't say that.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
I missed you.
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
So, are you a cheerleader?
How's my little cheerleader?
Oh, I have to hear this.

Anyway, I can say never to high school.
So tonight's the night.
Where did you get these?
I think you can.

Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Guess who?
Hi everyone, door was open.

Veronica, you look like hell.
What are you doing?
What's your damage, Heather?
God, aren't they fed yet?
God Veronica, drool much?
No way, no day!
Watch it, Heather.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
Shit.
Probably....
There are no stupid questions.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
It's not perfect.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do.
Trust me.

Kurt doesn't look too good.
We killed them, didn't we?
You believed it because you wanted to believe it.
Football season's over, Veronica.
Your son's dead and you love him.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
You shoulda stuck around, jerk.
You can be so immature!
Let's just.
We're breaking up. I am out!
You're getting too cool for me, J.
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
It's over, J.D.  Over!
Get off my bed, you sick psycho!

Tomorrow someone else will move into her place.
If you'll excuse me......

How do you turn the fucker off?
You really fucked me up, Veronica.

So, <u>Neil</u>.
Hey, c'mon.
Give it here, Bernard.
Was that your dad?
So where are all your toys?
Are you being helped, sir?
How's the new place?
I guess so.
Things are beginning to come to a head.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Oh, great.
Everything breaks at once.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.
Do you have a family?
About what?
I found a cent!
Hey.
Baby, what is it?
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
"Hi.
Mommy!
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Has anyone seen Rudolf?
He doesn't have a temperature.
Thank God.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Where'd he go?
Neil -- what --
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
Neil, calm down.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
We're going to think about it.
How were we -- were we cool?
<u>Now</u>, Neil.
Did you hear that?
How was lunch?
Do you remember who gave us this?
I hear things in this house,
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
I thought we'd be happy here.
The cab's waiting!
Did the cleaning woman come?
The floor has a nice shine to it.
He wants to see me!
What -- what are you doing?
Honey?
Who was that?
What?
Oh God.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
God, your sister's really hot.
Let's follow 'em.
Shit!
Are we gonna buy this house?
Okay!
Neil, do you mind?
Y'know what?
Hiya, sport.
You knew a second ago.
Do you see a man?
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Is it a king or a queen?
Promise?
I'd like that.
Really?
What the hell.
Hey, I don't have answers for this.
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
Lieutenant?
What do you think?
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
That's not all, Lieutenant.
Anything from the bank?
For Chrissake!
Detective Bedsoe.
When did you get back?
Where were you last night around nine?
She was a good woman.
I brought you here to talk about him.
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.
No.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy.
Yes -- I think it is.
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
I know that weapon.
You?
The prize?
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Must you do that?
Life.
The river.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?
I'm leaving.
Thank you, Thomas.
For being a friend when I needed one.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
What are we doing here?
To ask her to dance.
Yes.
Well?
I'll go first.
You can go first.
It will be a good harvest this year.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
This cannot be.
How comes it your are not afraid?
I've come to strike a bargain with you.
We had a bargain.  You promised.
Aye?
I cannot stay.
Leaving?  For how long?
Why?
You guys are from the British museum, right?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.
Corpses?
Yes.  How did you know?
Where did you get it?
You're hurt.
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
Why do you stare at me like that?
I don't have any answers for you.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
No.
Yes.
Good evening.
You didn't answer my question.
You have an interesting accent.
I'm just trying to place you.
That makes you uncomfortable?
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
Let me ask you something else.
That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
Would you like to see it?
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
Where will you go now?
He's in there!
Be careful, Conner.
What now?
Just a little.
We're holding the workers down below.
He's fine.
We found him this morning.
Incredible.
You stayed here again last night?
Do you?
It flatters me you remember, old one.
Impressive -- is it not?
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.
You know it's not safe here for you.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
Is there anything else you need?
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
Don't leave us, Conner.
Don't cry, wee one.
You kept it?
What are you doing?
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.
Dear, sweet, Rachel.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
Talley.
What'd you find out?
You get anything on Smith?
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.
You should warn them, Sonny.
Put our people on the scene.
Find out how we can hurt him.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.
What, he's cute?
Jen?  Are you all right?
Who sent you?
The car.  All you want is the car?
Stay down!
Mars, watch the cops!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.
Try to act cool, okay?
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
That woman's gonna call the cops.
That's why we gotta keep going.
We could've gone out the back!
I have to tell you something --
That cop didn't pull his gun.
Jesus.  What is this?
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis.
Someone should stay with Mr.
We can't carry all this.
We're fucked.
It's over.  We have to give up.
Then we might as well die rich.
You with the cops?
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
We're cool.
All three subjects are confirmed inside.
It's over now, Dennis!
Talley?
Hey, Dennis?
You're a funny guy, Talley.
That you, Talley?
We been through that.  Forget it.
Now I understand.
You've been in there a long time.
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
Who else is here?
He needs a doctor.
My father needs a doctor.
What about my father?
It's a safety room.
We can take it with us.
That's right.
The cops are comin'!
What the fuck is that?
Cops want to be rich like everyone else.
You got something to say?
Can you identify this man?
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?
Talley lives here.
Donuts here any good?
Are you out of your mind?
What if it goes south?
I heard he's fucked up.
How did you get this number?
What do you want?
Fuck the mall.
Take it easy.
They're close.
All right.  Now the second one.
I'll kill you!
I need to work out some stuff.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
I should've called.
I'm scared shitless.
Ow!  Shit!
No one's coming.
We can't carry him.
You leave that gun alone!
He can't reach us in here.
Want one?
What do you want?
What?
Make the pizza.
Kevin left without you.
You'd better get out of here!
Now we can do whatever we want.
Please get away from me.
You gotta pee?
Thanks for the shirt.
What do you want?
What happened?
Are civilians inside?
What's going on?
I'm the chief of police here.
Smith!  Wake up!
I'm not going to wake him.
That's enough.
What are you talking about, shot?
That's not enough.
Is something wrong with Jane?
One at a time!
Chief?
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
Louise?
Louise?
Chief, base.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
Do it.
Sounds like you know the job.
Then get your men off the wall!
He says that his father's hurt.
You want me to stick around, I could --
Excuse me?
Let it go, Captain.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Chief, Mikkelson.
It's mine.  Talley.
Mickey?
Okay, here's mine.
What are you people going to do?
The kids are in here!
This is Chief Talley.
Slow down, Thomas.
That's on the second floor.
I've got the boy on the phone.
Is my daddy okay?
Can you open them?
I don't see any people names.
Yeah!
Are the disks still in your room?
Where are my children?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Did you find the disks?
Where's your gun?
Who are you?
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass.
Can we let go?
Marlon and Al....
When this phone rings, you answer.
I guess we each have something the other wants.
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
What happened?
Paul!
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
Who are you?
What is this about?
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Captain, I must take my family.
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
Please, I don't use guns.
You want to pay me?
Ten.
Give me it.
Don't be foolish.
Paul, you know who this is?
Hold the line here.
Anything. Strong.
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
You're fucking black!
They fired a rocket at us.
What is it?
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
Satellites.
The Americans!
He did.
I will see what I can do.
Where are my supplies?
General, sir.
We must go to the Diplomat.
Where are they going?
You know what the Scottish call it?
I am going to do you a great favor.
We are better here.
You are a marked man.
You lie.
Time is money, George.
A bargain buy, from China.
What do you mean George?
Let's go.
Satellite feed.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
You fucking see that!
Here, have a sandwich.
Lets go, Jock.
Great, I really need a shower.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
There are no more rooms.
Mr. Manager.
Where are we going, sir?
Are you sure this is the river road?
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
Perfect timing.
You are the manager?
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Are you trying to make a fool of me?
Who did you call?
What do you want?
Excuse me.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
Terrible times, Paul.
Was there blood?
It is dangerous to be here.
I will need a suite.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
This time the Militia will kill us.
They should go one truck at a time.
Thomas wants advice?
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Do something.
No.
Paul!
The president has been murdered.
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Oh, my God!
What is it, Paul.
Paul, don't let them die.
Them.
This won't do.
Any luck?
Has Roger spoken yet?
This is not bad news, Tatsi.
My sister is dead, Paul.
They are being evacuated.
Listen to me woman.
You could leave, Paul.
Go to the roof now.
Lynch Bages, 84.
What's the matter?
I have to go out to get food.
I hear we must pay for everything.
I have a confession. When we met...
I will not leave without the twins.
A little longer, Paul?
Ask them to wait a little longer.
I have to stay.
Let me go. Children get off.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
We are almost out of water.
We have to have a plan.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
Oh, my babies.
Can I have your name again?
Very well.
Rutaganda's place?
Twelve are dead.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
What do we do with all these people?
What are you doing?
Where has all our beer gone?
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
What is this about no water?
Paul. Are you alright?
Out? Where are you going?
All. What do you mean all?
Paul, are you there?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
Why the hurry, Roger?
There are soldiers.
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Easy.
It's not, baby.
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Part of the original structure.
Mr. Price?
Jesus H. Christ!
Looks like we're it.
Oh, for chrissake --
More the merrier.
Now what do we do?
Don't think it'll be a problem.
What are you playing here, Price?
You're not my list.
There must be some other way out.
Melissa!
What?
Where is it??
I'm sorry --
Upstairs, too.
Oh, really: who?
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
This thing's going nowhere.
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
-- I did: down here.
'Less the place really is haunted.
You said that was an accident.
So, what?
What's in there?
What is it? What's in there?
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia.
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
What's down there?
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Oh. Jesus.
Uhhhh...
If you know where it is, get there!
Pritchett, is that you?
Pritchett!
Right here, Mr.
This is nuts.
I'll meet you down there.
Married.
Oh, Jesus....
-- the stained glass --
-- closed.
Is she...alright?
Thanks.
What? Deep down inside?
Well, she went somewhere!
You hear somebody?
We can do it...
I was upstairs with Eddie --
-- you lose either way, Price --
Good point.
What are you looking for?
Cheery looking bunch.
Holy shit!
Or an on-line computer.
This is the best we're gonna do.
Price!!
It's okay, everything's okay now.
Don't think it's even an issue.
What --
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Where did it go?
You okay?
What?
...Jesus H. Christ.
I knew this whole place'd be pure gold!
...birds.
So, what?
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
-- forget it.
Don't touch me!
Could we have a word?
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
What are you talking about?
And where are we off to, Mr. Price?
Fine with me.
Game, set and match, Steven.
Jesus!
Steven --
No...
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
You think this is fucking funny??
...wow....WOW!
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
Ever seen one that starts at the top?
First time for everything.
Do something!
Please! Something! Oh-God!
She's been marked for it.
I'm ready now.
-- it's getting older by the second.
I think...I may have the answer.
House 2, Guests 0.
Vannacutt!!
He was right! Pritchett was right!
Yeah.
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
Sorry.
What is it??
-- the window and door grates --
I was upstairs!
Well, I don't.
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Problem where? Looked good to me.
-- hey!
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Of course he did, for God's sake.
Oh, no.
Don't know that it does.
Won't do any good.
Uh, excuse me?
Ghosts killed your father?
There is something very not normal going on here!
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
Price!
Pritchett: what is going on?
-- hey! --
-- Eddie!!
Please.....anyone....help me?
I feel something.
Damn it.
Did you find something?
It doesn't say.
So many unanswered questions.
They don't build them like this anymore.
Town records are coming up now.
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
It looks delicious...
Did you find her?!
Are you all right?
It will heal.
Good-bye.
Where does this amulet come from?
What do these ingredients mean?
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
Can I do it again tonight?
Don't play games with me, little girl.
It's going to hurt us!
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Can you talk to her?
She's down...
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
My angel!
Are we leaving mommy?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
H-how long will it take?
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
Oh my God, what happened to you?
She says she's lonely...
She's down.  Help her...
Help me!  Please!!!
Can I have this room daddy?
What's he doing daddy?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
Look daddy!  It's empty!
We're here Aubrey!
I can't move!
Mommy please help me!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Are we going back to California daddy?
Good night Angel...
Mommy!
I could use a little help.
What's the matter?
It's just going to take a while.
To our family.
I wish I knew more about her.
God rest her soul.
Are you playing tricks on me?
What the hell is that?
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
...set up some more things.
The heater's here.
What is it?
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.
But do you agree with me?
It just disappeared.  Literally.
Whoa there...
What are you talking about?
How are we doing?
Oh my God where is she!
Aubrey!
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm fine.
You don't think I know?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Maura, what is this!
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
Maura!
Are you all right?
You're bleeding.
Not at all.
We don't know.
I think we should do it.
Where is your daughter?
Ok, so we have a.
I'm not sure, but I can check.
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
You must be a Londrigan.
...at her request.
Thank you.
She attended the church for years.
Your daughter's been taken.
I'm going to need some blood.
Now you must listen to me.
Go ahead.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
You must be the new tenants.
My name is Father Seamus.
What was she afraid of?
Did you have dinner, father?
Well there's no time like the present.
We'll never know for sure.
This isn't happening...
What...amulet?
How long will it take!
Keep talking!
The rain is letting up.
Take care of the girl.
Well, you know where to reach me.
No.
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.
Where did you find this?
Do you mind if I borrow it?
There's something in there.
What do you mean?
What, you think I'm kidding?
C'mon, Joey.
Not on station time.
I know.
Better hurry, Doc.
Hello?
Wait .
Well done.
The war pulled poetry out of some of us.
Something bad.
Kirsty Cotton.
I like you, Joey.
Wha .... ?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Hold on.
Look, lady!
Under The Underground.
Uh-huh?
You like ... left me a card?
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
I put some decaf on.
What?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
Sorry.
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
I figured I'd make breakfast.
I'll boil some water.
This is great.
How have you ... ?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
... but it is good.
But I don't know what's going on.
I was downtown looking for a .
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
Terri?
For somebody else, alright?
What am I looking for?
Joey ... ?
No.
Never mind.
Welcome. 38
... Let it define you.
Yes really.
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
It doesn't bother me.
But you gave me a rose ...
What ... What ... ?
That had nothing to do with the world.
I understand.
Don't flee from yourself.
A dark star rising.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
How do we start?
Joey?
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
Not quite.  This wasn't here.
Yeah right.  Look ...
I don't think so.
That's terrible.
Really?
Oh thank God, you're dead...
That was beautiful.
The security's actually not that severe.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
Eighth room down, babe...
That's the first thing I did.
Looks like you've been expanding your...
That's your definition of "Hard?"
I didn't know how to tell you.
Hmmmm.....
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel!
The safe's a Simpson 71.
This isn't funny.
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers.
Alex!
Cameras?
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
You got about five minutes and change.
The song's over!
Did I miss anything?
The Butler did it.
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
You bastard.
Rio, Alex?
We're going in from the ground floor.
Shwoof, that makes me feel better.
Count of three?
Now that's a lock.
That was close....
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
Alex, are you....
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
My life is not some deal.  I...
Welcome back to Vinci.
How.
Don't you just hate kids...
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.
Italy, France, Moscow.
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.
What the hell....
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
Hit me with your best shot.
"Messed around" messed around?
You got it.
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot.
Tough guy.
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.
Whoa.
Whoa, part 2.
And I'll bring my entourage...
This is bueno.
What have you been doing?
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
I'm sorry.
Catholic girls are scary...
It's not what you think.
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
Hudson, don't you understand...
Where did you get this?
You better believe I can.
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
Oh Hudson...
I hope you know what....
I wanna know...
Way to go, Anna.
Cat got his tongue?
How many times do I have to say it?
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.
Hawk, you're a great thief.
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
Good job, not pretty, but good.
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?
No, let me!
Alchemy!
I knew it!
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
Have a seat.
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect?
The auction house, asshole.
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.
All this trouble for a horsey.
Anybody have a cigarette?
Get away from there, convict!
Big girls don't cry-I-eye.
Cool, isn't it?
Sure.
Bunny, not you too?
I hate a man with a sense of humor.
You killed a friend.
This is the worst night...
Don't be stupid...they...
Damnit, I hate this!
Don't I know you...
I Want to make things up to you.
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.
Thanks for sharing.
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
I can't believe this.
Why does this have to be so hard...
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
Something short.
The Daddy-Oh!
The Hoopsucker!
My God, why?
Nobody told me!
Who are you?
...Hello?
And is this guy from chumpsville?
About seven minutes.
Ol' satchel-butt...
-- and she's dynamite!
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs.
Hungry, anyway.
What a horrible little person.
Cigarette?
You're from Muncie?!
...A Muncie girl!
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
...You know! For kids!
Confused?
...What happened?
Sid found me the icepack.
...Certain people are --
...The people look like ants.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
Oh, Norville --
For Pete's sake, Norville!
Now, Amy --
...You son of a --
...Oh, it's you!
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
...On payday!
I can't print this!
You don't know anything!
Muncie.
You can't print that!
Archer, you're a broken record.
Whatever!
Just got hired today!
Terrific.
How long've you been down here?
I want a martini!
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
...Geez.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
Say, buddy!
My pleasure, sir.
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
...Why, this is worthless.
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Awwww, buddy --
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
...You don't?
Oh, geez.
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker.
...Yeah, go ahead.
...This'll only take a moment.
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
Well, frankly, I...
...Who let you in?
...You know, for kids!
...education, were you?
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
...'Shnook'?
But --
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
You nitwit!
Why you nitwit.
Not that way! Through the door!
Up on your feet!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
Relax, Norville.
Finally.
Sorry I'm late, Sid.
I got gas, Bennie.
...Enter the dame.
She finds him.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
...No money.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
Yellowstone.
She's got other problems, of course...
Maybe he's wise.
She isn't!
She's good, Bennie.
Good morning, miss.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma.
What's this?
I think you need some help.
Thank you, Mrs.
I'd love to.
Some of this native nonsense.
Mrs. Rand.
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless.
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you.
Mrs. Rand...
Does she suffer?
She can never be cured?
I've worked with it.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
You're single?
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.
-- But, you're an American?
Don't worry.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
Where do you think you're going?
But don't you have to work?
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
I wish I hadn't heard --
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
Does she suffer?
She's dead.
No, Wes.
It is not beautiful.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
Can't I take it for you?
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
Why was the maid crying?
A mental case?
I suppose so.  Yes.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
You don't seem very disturbed by it.
I heard you playing.
You have helped me.
Well?
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
I wanted to help you.
You think I love Jessica and want her back.
You wanted to warn me...
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.
Wesley!
I think I do.
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
I don't know -- I don't know--
An accident at the mill?
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
We're all in it.
That isn't true.  You never understood her.
Benjie!
OK, OK, the defense rests.
Don't be so modest, Ben.
You're staring at me.
Then again, why should she be?
Good night.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
I'm, uh, going to bed.
Oh yeah.
You all right there?
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
You crying?
The turkey in?
Dinner in ten minutes.
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's.
What's for dessert?
Don't start.
Oh lord.
You've...
This just isn't the best moment for this.
Elena, it's not what you think.
Ready to go?
Elena.
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
Hi dad.
So how's school treating you?
About?
Holy!
Um, Paul.
See you.
Ah let the guy have his fun.
It's like farming.
Here.
Huh?
Oh jeez, Benjie.
A prior engagement overcame me.
Dad stop it!
Fascist!
Good-night dad.
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Talking to me, dad?
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it.
Your toes cold?
But...
It's not the taxes I object to.
Oh.
What?
Good shit.
Thank you Janey.
Hello you two.
You want coffee or something?
Things are really rotten at home.
You okay?
Hi mom.
I saw you on your bike today.
We're going to the Halford's.
I don't like coffee.
Please don't.
Oh.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
Here you are.
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
My daughter.
Reverend Edwards.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
No more man.
How can you do that man?
Huh?
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
Check it out.
Awesome sleet and rain.
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
No candy for me?
Come on Paulie, share the wealth.
Jesus, Jim!
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
Um, Libbets.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Maybe you should have just a half.
Yeah.
I do.
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Mikey?
Where you going?
Want some gum?
Did you tell Sandy?
I don't ever want to see you.
You have to follow me?
See, no one's here.
Maybe we can mess around.
Wow!
When worlds collide.
You're parents at that party?
Charles.
Hello, Charles.
How are the parental units functioning these days?
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Hood residence.
Hey Wendy.
Well, you can...
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
He's dead.
Well.
Want a drink?
It feels warm.
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
I love you.
Yes, sir.
Didn't want to miss anything.
Just after Leland Street.
Nice kid.
So far.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I have to get back.
My partner...
You did your homework, Officer.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
Typical seventeen year-old.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
Who's that?
This murder was in the papers, right?
I could say the same thing about you.
She your only sibling?
Oh, I shouldn't have...
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie.
But here's the thing.
Duggar called him?
Not really.
It's legitimate.
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.
No.
What about your shoulder?
Sorry about...
Thanks.
Oh, you know.
No.
She left the party early.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
We're sure it's hers?
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
What are you doing here?
Dormer.
I'll call him now.
Forget your pager?
Good.
No.
That's right.
Where you signed this?
She wasn't happy.
Randy Stetz?
Are you sure about that?
Eight years.
They're all over everybody.
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for.
What do you want to talk about?
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
Looks like the natives are restless.
I wish I could stick it out like you.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.
Your friend's all business.
I got it.
Fred Duggar?
Will...I...
One of your cases?
Will.
What if someone finds out?
Did you love her?
"She was nice.
I don't know.
Thought I smelled something.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
I was her best friend.
You want me to take you somewhere?
Hey...
You and Kay were like sisters?
No...
I don't know.
It was like some big fucking secret!
No game.
I'm sorry?
Down at the station?
She was only seventeen.
No.
You gave her gifts.
What about him?
Randy Stetz is in jail.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
What the hell do you know?
I told you that was an accident!
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
Yes.  Like that.
Where's your back-up?
Wild card.
Monstrous.
Disappointing, isn't it?
So you have the answers...
That is a picture, nothing more.
I understand.
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
I was waiting for you...
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
So soon?
And the vampires of the Theatre?
Are these not the answers you came for?
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
I couldn't prevent it.
You held sway over them.
You didn't even warm them, did you?
Your melancholy eyes...
More.
I want some more.
I'm not your daughter.
Why always on this night?
Some of these are so old and tattered.
Which of you did it?
Why yours alone?
What is it now?
Stop pestering me then!
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself.
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
Laudanum!
Don't Louis --
I want more.
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
Claudia! You did that?
You want me to be a doll forever?
We're immortal. You've always known that.
You see the old woman?
You... fed on me?
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
Should we burn him?
In Europe, Louis.
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis.
Louis, look at me.
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
What was that?
It can't be -
The ship is sailing wihout us!
How do I look?
A beautiful child!
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
Are they my kind Louis?
You know her?
But this can't be real.
Mortals, mortals everywhere.
They use no paint.
She's no vampire.
This is no performance.
This is monstrous!
I've seen enough of this!
I lothe them!
Do you think I would let them harm you?
He can protect us, Claudia.
How do we seem to you?
Oh God!
She is dying.
Bear me no ill will, my love.
They would have killed you -
Who the hell are you?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
What do you want from me?
Diane!!!!
You have to ask me for this.
Let's call that a start.
Don't worry.
You really want to be with them?
Did I hear a yes?
You're sure?
You're body's dying.
Come, you're going to feed now.
Take him.
What have I done?
Dear God, what have I done?
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend.
You must get into it.
You'll get used to killing.
I know. It gets cold so fast.
But we can live without taking human life.
Have you ever been caught?
The trick is not to think about it.
What have you done to me?
Consider yourself lucky.
They know about us.
You fool, what have you done?
Where are we?
We belong in hell.
What, no flowery speeches?
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
The girl, Lestat -
Why do you do this Lestat?
Lestat - finish this -
Unless I make her one of us...
Pain is terrible for you.
Do what it is in your nature to do.
Evil is a point of view.
She's here, your wounded one.
Lestat!
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me.
You are the devil!
Your mama's left you with us.
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn?
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
No... You come back to me Louis...
You'll come home with me Louis?
Still beautiful Louis.
It's only a siren...
I have to go now Lestat...
See?
You were going to kill me?
You believe this, don't you?
How did you do that?
What can I do to put you at ease?
You said the slave had a crucifix...
You loved Yvette...
Shall we go on?
But why did you tell her?
Did he die in the fire?
You found nothing?
Lestat escaped the fire!
No... it can't end like that...
Is this what you want?
Dear God.
You promise to care for her then?
Yes.
And the child who did die?
Look at the gaslight.
What can I do for you?
You're in 201 and 202.
Julie, we're talkin' suites!
Duh.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Your what?
Storm season?
Listen to me. He's here.
I want off this island.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
Stupid. Stupid.
I don't know, man.
Get lost, you scared me.
There's a storm comin', Titus.
I got work to do.
I thought you were out of town!
I thought you were out of town!
That was heart attack time, Karla.
I'm not going anywhere.
There's nothing between Will and me.
Say yes.
Karla!
That could break the machine.
The number's unlisted...
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
He's not coming.
Oh!
I'm the King of the World.
Hello? Hello?
Am I bad?
Karaoke -- perfect.
No way.
Think about this, Julie.
You get any sleep at all?
It's okay.
Nice move.
Cancer in a box.
Karla!
I'm not crazy.
Oh, stop it!
Julie...
Let him go. I believe him.
What do you mean?
Be careful, Julie.
There's no way to lock it.
I don't know...
Julie?
I'm holding your hand!
Oh, god, it's you --
I got in early.
Ray, I can't...
I understand something.
Hey.
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas!
Okay, I'll try.
Ray...what are you doing?
I love it here.
Checking the locks again?
I am not crazy, Tyrell.
We're all going to die.
Voodoo.
Don't kill me --
Julie! Wait! You okay?
The shower again?
It was one year ago...
Nah.
This was not my idea.
And it's been blue skies all day.
You sure it's okay with you?
Julie? What's wrong?
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
What? What are you talking about? Where?
There was a body! I swear it!
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Why are you doing this to me?
...Why?
Is there a problem here?
Ain't nothin' free in this world.
Oooh, the mainland --
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Pretty cool bar.
Tha's it.
Oh, look.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
I'll come with you.
Maybe we should just wait here?
You think that's a good place to hide?
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
To a great weekend --
Come on, it'll be fun.
Ahh, that feels great.
Why? He can't help us.
Mark in the Morning!
Rio de Janeiro!
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
Jeez, that's a full carat --
Hell, that's worth three, easy.
You guys lost?
What's the matter, boy trouble?
What's going on?
Can't talk right now.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
The last day of the season.
Where is everybody?
Take this.
They were cut loose.
The porter...what's his name?
We'll only be a second, okay?
Where'd Estes go?
You don't have to.
Where is Miss Wollsten?
But the gods played a little trick on me.
He is exhausted.
I need your advice  something has happened  Mr.  Jacks 
He complained of not feeling well.
I wonder if my editor's psychic?
Goodbye.
She's right.
You're just talking nonsense.
We will see who is the first to die.
) You feel the symptoms?
I'm here.
The enemy is in retreat.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
Another sad task.
You were singing, weren't you?
Good night, Oliver.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
I know it must be hard.
Where's Thea?
Oh, no - it's too delicious!
Tell me about them, Thea.
Poor child.
What are you doing?
I have been troubled about you.
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
It's getting dark.
You are fortunate in your father.
Thea -- you're hiding something.
I have forgotten it, dear.
Thea, your choice is a very simple one.
I felt he did not like me.
You should sleep, Cathy.
Suppose, she isn't dead.
Your father knew it too.
What would I be thinking?
No.
Woman, what are you doing here?
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman.
I don't really know where Thea comes from.
Your daughter is ill.
This girl --
Why not Take the doctor's advice?
You know that sound, Oliver?
Do you mind if I go with you?
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
You are a happy man Oliver.
There is something evil about her.
It makes me fear her.
Until we know, what choice is there?
Thea is so like her  in every feature 
She was beautiful.
I have had command for the last time -
Theodosia --
Daughter -- my daughter --
You're crying. Why?
What's bothering you, Thea?
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Thea, what's wrong?
Thea, what is this?
I don't think so, Thea.
Because she loved him.
Let me tell him.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Times are bad, Mr.
But they're somebody's children.
Come on, we got to get this up.
Get that ladder up here.
George . . .
All right, put up your hands.
Stand back.
Bert, now listen to me.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
Know you?
Good morning, sir.
You what? To save me?
Oh, I know all about you.
That's what I was sent down for.
I told you  I'm your guardian angel.
By letting me help you.
What'd you say?
What did you say?
Well, that's the doggonedest thing .
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it?
I can't fly.
You have no car.
Oh, I don't know.
What's the matter with him.
No.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
What do you mean, no identity?
What?
You know where he lives?
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
Clarence . . .

She's . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Where? I don't see a thing.
Why, yes. This is amazing.
Hey, who's that?

I know.
You sent for me, sir?
Hey .
Hey, Violet!
Thank you very much.
What's that?
Hey, Ernie!
Bert, the cop, sent this over.
Look, bud, what's the idea?
Is this the place?
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Well?
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me.
Well, sure I do.
Hi, Daddy.
Wait now.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
There it is, good as new.
What?
Daddy!
Oh, oh.
Hee-haw!
So long, George.
Big  see!
Now you're talkin'.
What boat you sailing on?
What's that?
Goodbye, everybody!
He's gone.
Oh, no  you don't feel so good.
She's swell.

Yes .
I'm going to miss old Annie.
Got a match?
Mary .
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Hello, George, how are you?
George.

Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
Hey, George . . .
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.

Avast, there, Captain Cook!
Uh-huh.
Hello.
Well, what do you know  wife.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
Why didn't you call me?
Yes, hello?
George, was it a nice wedding?
Those Rockefellers!
Now look, did you buy anything?
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Pop!
Pop!
Yes, sir.
Just a minute  just a minute.
Thank you, sir.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Yes .
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Made up your mind yet?
With coconuts?
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
Well, hello.
I'm not very good at this.
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
Do I look as funny as you do?
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
Oh, no, George, don't.
What'd you wish, George?
Oh, no.
I'll take it. And then what?
Ouch!
They're way downtown.
Hello, Mary.
My mother just called you?
When did you get back?
All right, for a minute.
Oh .

Where are we going?
After that, who cares?
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .

Hi.
George Bailey lassos stork.

Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
Where're you going?
Mary! Mary!
Oh, George, George, George.
Oh, you two idiots!
Pop, can I have the car?
I guess you forgot something.
How about that one there?
How fast does this go?
You can?
Come on, you guys.
For me...?
Great!  Find one for me.
Wheee!  Faster!
My hair's getting wet!
When do we get to the lighthouse?
I can't wait to get there.
Sure you do -- you win either way.
Oh, shit.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
It's okay, it's okay....
Bring her to port a little.
Don't!
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Get on the rocks!
Yeah, it's her job.
Who's that?
Maybe by now they are.
Why not?
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
Your dad must be really pissed.
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
The lighthouse?
Why'd they decide to move?
What is it?
Where're we going?
But we had it!
But the island!
We're carrying weight.
Coming up!  Give way!
Loser sails home alone.
Throw it.
I don't know.
Coming up!
I thought you said she was going with us?
You coming up on him?
Hey!
Sean!   Catch the rope!
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
Tina!
Good morning!
On your own time?
Chief....
I never heard of a 908.
We got a helluva tide this month.
Chief?
What about that camera?
I know just where to go.
How long ago?
I can't let you take her out.
Mike's out there.
Untie that rope.
You're too close.  Back off.
I'm going out there.
See where Cable Junction is?
Where to?
I'm going.
You stay here a minute.
Pop....
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Michael.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
Mike?  Is that you?
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Jesus, don't freeze on me.
Dad, I'm sorry....
Fantastic lady.
May I have this dance?
Wait a minute....
It came up during the meeting.
What are you all, blind?
What have you seen before?
There is nothing to discuss.
Look at that:
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
The shark that did this.
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Carcharadon Carcharias.
Where the hell were you?
Do I have to talk to those two?
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
Listen -- what are you doing later?
Let's get the kid home.
Mmmm.
Sean's awake.
Mrs. Silvera?
Need a ride?
Hey!  That's my boss!
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Eat Cheerios.
Where's my day book?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
Oww!
All summer?
I know what you're going to say.
Hi.
What's wrong?
What?
What're you going to do today?
Hey -- it's not your job any more.
What're you doing?
What is it?  What's the matter?
Hello, hello.
I'm showing summer rentals.
Are you serious?
Bullshit.
Thank God you guys were all together.
Martin, it could be anything.
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Where the hell is Air One?
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Can I go swimming?
Some people.
Can I go with you today?
Hi Dad.
Hang on!
They made me go with them.
Is that me?
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
I told you, remember?
What's wrong?
It killed her.  It ate her.
We're going to die.
How old is your cousin?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
She just likes to tease.
Mike!  Are you going out?
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Whoops, almost lost one.
Terry!  You okay?
Get a dance yet?
No class.
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
Anyone know what time it is?
Maybe it's gone.
The wind drift is lateral.
Take a break for a minute, okay?
Eddie, can we do that?
Come on back up here!
What about the others?
But first, a little juice....
Right after, the Kids went out?
Hurry, please.
Be careful....
How much longer?
About damn time.
What is it?
It comes here from Cable Junction.
What's the lighthouse?
Too hot tor those two?
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
I thought you were grounded.
That's fun!
I don't care.
What's wrong?
Faster!  Faster!
Mike and Larry are racing!
Heading back?
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
Who wouldn't.
They're turning around.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
I want Fruit Loops!
You're going out.
Yeah.
I think we got a couple of live ones.
Wave to my son.
Oh, my God....
You should've been out there.
Be reasonable, please....
We're ready for you.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
It hasn't adjusted.
Don't feel bad.
Go on, Doctor.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
I don't understand.
I'll need more men to look.
What's your plan, Brody?
It's Miller time!
You see the three-quarter socket?
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Thank you.
Well, not much longer to go.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Damn it.
That macho pompous English --
You called, Doctor?
They're coming with us?
Where's the rubber band?
What do I do now?
Honey... you all right?
Damn it!
It's romantic down here.
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
You would, wouldn't you?
You all right?
Michael...
How the hell did it get in here?
You're going down there again?
Oh, yeah.
Fine piece of engineering.
Kathryn...
Change your mind?
You want me to stay?
Finally.
Mmmm... you smell good.
They said you'd be here.
No, we'll go through here.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
Honey, what is it?
What's the big deal?
That's what I've come to ask you.
What did you just say before?
Somebody better get down there!
Come on!
How is he?
That's right.
Are you okay?
Go where?
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
It's no use.
Unhappy combination.
You can get killed!
I will.
I want that shark alive.
You look like an orange worm.
Lunch for Whitey.
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
How's sleeping beauty?
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
You were quite daring in capturing him.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.
Sharks have to keep moving.
He's big as a bloody bus!
A piece of pie on Sunday.
I think they'll come out now.
He's a young one.
When did this happen?
I knew it;  it's my fault.
No one's ever done it before.
Give me a ride?
Musclehead?
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Hi, Mike.
So, you just get here?
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Well, I needed a cold shower.
This is where to be.  High and dry.
You were great out there!
Herpes?
Sean, do you have herpes?
Besides that.
Isn't this fun!
Told you you'd like it.
No...  It can't be.
Let's go, let's go!
Take it up!
The space shuttle has landed!
I don't talk that way.
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.
Ahhh, ahhh...
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Did you see that?
Bring the crane over.
Make sure you put this back.
Watch it, Brody.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
How far away is filter number four?
I'll go with you.
He's big, Hutton.
What kind of trouble?
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
We see him, Mike.
How'd you do in school?
Took it this morning.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Come on, let's go.
Mike, this is fantastic.
She still talking to you?
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
You want to show this?
You'll spoil her.
Thea....
It has its virtues.
Come on, sweetheart....
Daddy, why can't I...?
You're welcome.
Only children are my favorites.
Can I make sandwiches...?
I bought him his first legal drink.
Where are you going?
What do I think?
Like mother, like son....
It sure is good to be home....
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.
Make a list.
I miss him, Matt.
How come it's my responsibility?
What the hell are we arguing about?
No fair, I'm not armed.
Close the door.
Where have you been...?
You knew...?
Sweetheart....
Why didn't you tell us?
It'll grow on you.
You want to try your hand at something...?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
All he did was kiss me....
Beginning of what?
Michael!  This thing working?
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
They won't kill it....
Stop that....
That hurt....
I see what you're doing....
Are you all right?
We don't want any....
The fish.  Check it....
Ask the big doctor about his work.
A big one....
Don't be late.
In a minute....
Yes!
Can I ride one sometime...?
I never....
I like Grandma's cooking....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
Your father was six then.
You're coming, aren't you...?
No one.
I almost forgot....
I put everything in my room.
I'll be in to read you a story.
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
It came for him.
Sit down, Ma....
Mom, you're upset.
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.
Oh, I didn't mean.
I didn't mean to start that....
All you all right?
How are you doing?
I'll be all right, Michael.
Nothing out of the ordinary....
I want you to give up your work....
You're having a good time....
I enjoy his company....
It's not easy.
That's it?
It's late....
You and Sean used to make....
You hungry?
It got him....
Promise me you'll be all right....
No....
Can you just go off...?
Flies the plane....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy.
Depends on where you want to go....
How can you just take the plane like this?
What are you doing?
It's just like driving a car....
How do you like flying?
What's wrong?
I'm fine.
You promised me a drink....
A drink with an umbrella in it....
Would you suffer through a dance with me?
I have two right feet.
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I tried winter once.
I could take some time off....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
You sure you don't need glasses?
I tried to tell you...I tried....
I can't....
They had them on the big one....
I'll get it back next time.
Want to go for a little ride?
You the architect?
Hurry!
Can you keep a secret?
It was theirs anyway.
I hope she's a good sailor....
You're going after her in that?
What do you mean, it'll find her?
Grab your socks....
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
Keep it steady....
Mind if I cut in?
I want you to leave her alone.
Can't this thing go any faster?
Come on, Hoagie....
What happened?
Matt?
Yeah....
Let me speak to Ellen....
Stop farting around....
How many...?
I know how to tag a damn conch....
I missed you, is all.
Maybe I missed you too....
Bad boy....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
How many?
I wish you wouldn't say that....
Where is everybody?
What happened to Clarence and...?
What for?
I don't know shit about electronics....
You sure you've done this before?
And it's always worked?
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
How long have you known Hoagie?
Bring her to starboard.
What's so funny about that?
Bring her about.
We lost it....
I'm coming...How close is it?
You getting a reading on them?
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
Shit....
You told me what?
Holy Christ....
What the hell are you doing?
All the time....
Your equipment has crapped out again....
I'll do it, Jake.
How much longer?
She's in management....
Woman has taste....
That bad, huh?
That man keeps calling about his training film.
Where's Lenny?
Did you like that, Mama?
Did you bring it with you?
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him?
No, Sir.
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper.
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
What about that kid, Ross?
What do you think?
We give it one more hour.
Yeah, he can go ...
Who is who?
Not for me ..
How's the new residence?
What time is it?
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
It's an "unsolved.
He thinks you stole his promotion.
It's a technique I read about.
You want my advice?
You gotta stop smoking ..
What do you mean?
Why don't you dump it?
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Where is everyone?
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
What do you want it for?
What are you doing, Ross?
That isn't what you said before.
You believe me, don't you?
Did he shut you down?
Did I say he did?
Why's she blind, Bro?
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Stop it.
She wasn't lying about the van.
Well .. I didn't know that ..
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
Ease off, John ..
I dunno what I can do to help you?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
Jesus. What are you doin?
What exactly you doing, John?
Listen, you don't havta come?
Where's your watch?
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates.
What if we need a back up?
Alright.
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
What is that?
How do you know her hair's black?
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe.
What do you want me to do, Chief?
You're pushing this too hard.
I never asked if he could "see.
Alright, you got it.
I'll sign anything you want.
Week or two.
What does that mean, Sergeant?
Is this normal?
Did he get you the job?
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
His blind friend got "attacked.
So read it!
You don't know what you done, Taylor.
I know what a "witness" is.
He's offerin you a deal?
I've told you the truth.
Yes, Sir.
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
You must have some idea about him.
John?
The elevator wasn't working?
Can I see your hands?
Is there anything else you can tell me?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Did Amber have a dog?
Have you been here long?

She has an aunt, in Vermont.

I just heard.
It's all about you, isn't it?
Jerry.
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
Don't say it.
Listen to me!
Didn't hear it.
No one has ever dumped me.
Oh Jerry.
Wait.
Don't let him stay up too late.
He's asleep, right?
Let me think about that.
Reporters, Jerry.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry?
... this is... uh... too funny...
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
Airight.
No no...
Can I help?
Well, thanks.
Oh no.
Oh no.
Wonder what he said.
And I guess we didn't talk about money.
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
That took guts.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
No, that's fine.

Happy for us.
Okay, have we gone over everything?
Hey you.

Wow.

It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery.
Maybe you should call her.
Yeah.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Oh God.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
Sure you're okay to drive this?
What --
If I said that, would you stay?
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Why do you love me?
It's my fault.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
What if it's true?
There's no question you'll be friends.
This used to be my specialty.
What about medical?
You are a single mother.
Wait. Where is he?
He's coming over.
He just lost his best client.
I heard.
That's the girl I love.
Forgot your keys --
No no.
First you gotta tell me something.
No, Roy.
Oh yes.
Oh, thank you.
Denver is where he should be.
What happened to Denver?
Not right now, Jerry.
Now.
I got it.

At last I find you.
I came all the way here for that?
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
Good.
You love me now, don't you?
Rod --
See this jacket I'm wearing?
You are not allowed to act this way.
--  the kwan.
I got there from "coin," dude.
Is that your porty or mine?
You're telling me to dance.
What's wrong.
I'm out here for you!
If you get injured, you get nothing.
I'll get you some quick work --
Dude, know your art form.
Oh I know plenty.
First, single mothers don't "date.
The kid is amazing.
You never had The Talk, did you?
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Well, just stay healthy.
Not everyone has what you have.
I'm sorry I asked.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Jerry!  You made it --
Thanks for coming.
I have to ask.
Oh, tell the story.
Well, it bothered me somewhat.
Which they do.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
How can I make your life better?
You gonna get that --
Marcee, things are changing around here.
I'll go back to them.
Okay, we don't take this emotionally.
Marcee --
I'm sorry what I said back there.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Cronin's okay for lunch?
Pardon me?
You...
... dick?
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!
One-two-three, swing.
Hi.
Let's go right now.
I won't tell.
I don't see any.
What's going on, Jerry?
Show me the animal, Jerry!
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
He should have kept his head tucked down.
ERRR-IIIC!
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before.
Eric!
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Do you think it goes all the way across?
Oh, my God.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
Well, I'm no aviation specialist.
Amanda, Honey!
We can't just...
Her new boyfriend.
Sorry.
How much weight have you lost?
You look good.
Stop that.
Young adult.
That's him. Thats Eric!
I'm sorry Amanda.
Eric! Are you here?
Udesky.
It's not safe.
We can't just stop looking.
Well what?
This wouldn't happen if he was with you.
I don't know.
What?...WHAT!?
Sweetheart, you're okay.
Eric, its okay.
Paul!
We should try fishing again.
You see, that's just the thing.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
He's right.
We need to stick to the plan.
You had the phone the whole time?
PAUL!
Where's Dad?
We have to keep looking for Dad.
That was Isla Nublar.
I dont know.
Eric!
How was your trip? Profitable?
You rented an automated litter box.
Absolutely not.
I'm so use to seeing bones.
Is it a rex?
How would you classify it?
It looks intact.
We could co-write a paper.
ALAN!
We need to keep moving.
You have to believe me.
I CAN GET HIM!
Hmm?
He used to know me.
Anything good?
You remember the sounds they made?
Good luck with the fund raising.
I'd better get going.
Eric, your parents are both here.
They'll never make it.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Is that all it's been?
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Know what this is?
How much of this island have you explored?
Do you have any kids?
Bonitas.
We're safe!
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
Hmmm.
That's hard to believe.
What the hell is going on?
No, I'm sorry, but no.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
Well that's good.
Amanda!
Billy!
How did you know?
But alone?
Sorry.  We were saying?
It matches the pictures.
Make a blind here?
You hear something?
Any damage?
Is there an antidote?
Resentful.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
What?
I'm not going, John.
Oh --
Do you have chromium tapes?
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
But he's the head of InGen!
Are you looking for a problem?
That was a pair bond!
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.
Ian, you're not insane!
And let's forget about the high hide.
Hi, Dad.
Is that kid still bothering you?
I could come with you.
How could you possibly?
"InGen."  What's InGen?
What are you guys gonna do?
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
Dad!
Cancel that, Dieter.
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.
Where do you think you're going?!
What kind of gun is that?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
What?
Had to.
What in Christ's name is going on?!
What is?
What is that?
Where's the power and radio setup?
The radio rig is inside.
We took to the rock.
It's... behind... us.
What's he got in there?
Their what?
What?
She's gutty.
No way.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Then this is our chance.
There' no reason for name calling.
?!
What do they want?!
No.
Lava?
Come on!
We can't stay in here!
Head for the roof!
Something's wrong.
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
No more smoking.
You're going home.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Can you set up?
Born free, as free as the wind blows.
All right.
Oh, God.
Ian.  It's guano.
So what's your story, Nick?
-- way we could safely --
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.
That little black line?
Give it more morphine!
Hold it down, Nick!
WHAT ARE YOU-
Where's Kelly?
We have to send someone to look for him!
Ask her.
You've got to be kidding.
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course.
I found a way to re-route through the program.
What?
Phones are out too.
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours?
How many lines of code are there?
But would we get the phones back?
How long will this take?
You shouldn't use my name.
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
What?  No menthol?
Paleo-DNA?
Alan?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
Yes.
Sure.
Did I say jerk?
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
There you are.  Out you come.
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
Malcolm's okay for now.
Carousel.
Once we have control again we - -
Mr. Arnold?
Four complete skeletons.
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
Okay, who's the jerk?
And what are those?
Why would they care what we think?
The movement!
You've got a T-rex!
So what are you thinking?
Wait a minute!
Oh, shit.
Oh Ellie.
Constantly sick.
- - like birds - -
Are you sure?
It's just the two raptors, right?
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving.
Ellie, com one!!
Dr. Grant!
Do you see anything?
Alan?!
What about the lysine contingency?
I can't wait anymore.
I'm going with you.
Come on, let's go.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
C'mon on, this way.
No. We can't.
It's all right.
No.
That's right.  Will break through.
God creates dinosaurs.
You see?
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
Alan?
Dino droppings?
Can we chance moving him?
Faster, faster!
Seven days?
Yes?
Hola, Juanito
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
I can't see.
Up and down, up and down!
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
This is overwhelming, John.
And we can charge anything we want!
I don't believe it.
Have a heart gentlemen.
I read your book.
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
These look kind of familiar.
Are you okay?
I threw up.
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.
Straight-A brainiac!
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Take a bite, take a bite.
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
You know what this is?
It's a bit of a climb.
I can't!  I'm scared!
Go, go, go, jump!
Are you crazy?
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
Cloning from What?
You got any kids?
You're married?
What'd I touch?!
Their radio's out too.
Where does he think he's going?
Oh my God!
Hey, we were saving that!
Not just kids - - for everyone.
Can't you stop these things?!
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Robert.
Ah - - they're here.
Tim!  Lex!
He's knocked out!
Dad - - Dad - -
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
It's safe?
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
Tim, Tim, Tim....
Go away!
I like cows.
What's that?
Watch how it eats!
Let's go!
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
Do as he says!
Shhhh.
What works?
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!
A load, if I may say so.
Your silence intrigues me.
You don't give us our due credit.
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.
I am totally unappreciated in my time.
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
Sustain winds 45 knots.
Well?
We miss you.
What's going to happen to the goat?
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
I don't know, I don't know.
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
I hate trees!
I'm a hacker!
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!
That's not funny.
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
Hello?
Fifty.
Chain saws.
Jesus Christ!
Mister Biller?
There doesn't seem to be any water damage.
Hello?
I don't know...
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
Two.
Quite a circus.
What?
Ruby, come on.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.
What's going on?
It's still on.
What happened?
Three.  Where's my client?
A house?
Are you going to plead insanity?
Sorry.
You think that's going to work?
You watch this garbage?
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
Well?
Oh?
This is bad, Joe.
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
I don't believe it.
That's the problem with this case.
Don't get me wrong.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile?
Not much here.
How long will he need to be asleep?
Well, that's it.
There's nothing to see here.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
See this?
It's all right.
You saw him?
What are you doing?
Where's he going?
You know how to use one of those?
What's that?
We're down to seven minutes.
Are you all right?
What happened? Where's Jason?
You work in the insurance department?
Where do you live?
It's only majestic from here.
My assistants, I presume.
You look like brothers.
Fine -- terrible.
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
-- Merely in the interests of order.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
You work in the cemetery.
-- You appreciate my writing.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
You wanted to see me, sir.
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
Was there something else?
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
Hello again.
I was having an affair with Eduard.
What's funny?
How long were you and Eduard --
No, I don't.
Are you free tonight?
You almost married recently, didn't you?
-- I don't know the Musil district.
I nominated you as a possible candidate.
And you still maintain -- what?
You think what we're doing is so wrong?
I'm collecting Eduard's things.
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
Gabriela ...?
Only two steps back?
I think you've just escaped for the moment.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
Probably not.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
Do you?
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
What's the matter with you?
My assistants.
... Why take me into your confidence?
That's <u>mad</u>.
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?
... A piece of paper ...
-- You seem amused.
May I ask where your two warders are?
I'm overworked as it is.
Wait a minute.
What's the matter?
All these in the last year?
Ludwig.
He can't sit still.
Women are all you have on your mind!
They keep switching us from department to department.
It's not our fault.
We've been together too long.
But your goal is so hard to reach.
Oskar!
This is filed incorrectly!
We could go back to the office.
Then that's the place for us!
Hi - Carl Denham.
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
Can I see the map?
Get the hell out of here.''!
What have you got there?
Father!
Out!
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
He's grubbing for money, father.
Holy God! The mummy walks!
God, you're so obnoxious!
I'm sorry ...
Where do I charter a boat?
Can you fly?
Yeah!
I want to thank you.
There's a light up ahead.
It's the same image - Kong!
Jack!
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
Give it back!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Jesus Christ !
Ann ... Ann!
There's no island there.
I guess that answers your questions.
They're stoking the boilers.
Just take it easy .
You are most kind.
Man Eater!!!
Did you see her?
Listen buddy!
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
Hey!
They were just tasting the berries.
Set up the camera boys!
I'm calling a wrap.
Denham!
Not me.
Are you nervous Jack?
Did you fear for your life?
It must have been terrifying?
Are you gonna start it up?
Trina this is Klute.
Why? She's a junkie.
Enjoy.  Well --
-- May I? It's so --
I know: it's ridiculous.
All right.
-- I have to close up now.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide.
Oh no.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
It puzzles me so badly.
What is it?
What about?
Who?
Is it the shakedown hon?
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
A name.
You remind me of my uncle.
Well could I have them back now hon?
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared.
Is that how you get most of your dates?
I have some names the police gave me.
Klute, tell me, what's your bag?
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
What? This?
You've changed your mind?
Well do you think it was him?
What did you expect?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
It's kind of late.
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
What's the matter hon?
What's the matter?
Please.
I'm still scared.
I am scared.
I saw Mr.
Spangler says we have a relationship.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Oh look what he did in them.
Listen to me: It's all right.
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
Where'd you spend last night?
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything.
Please.
I got a call from Ross this morning.
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs.
Look -- yes.
How can you not think so?
Look, why should it be yes or no?
Sorry we had to meet here.
I can't follow you.
Well --
John, how are you?
Would you like to know what's in it?
I've always respected Bree.
I'm looking for a man.
OK, a family matter.
Klute.
Sounds to me you better shake him again.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
He's right you know.
Well?
Think this is our guy?
But what reason could he have?
Gov, want to leave me that one.
Are you closing the case?
Klute knew Tom.
Mr. Kramer?
Where is the child?
What do you have here, Billy?
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
What do you like best about her?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Greatest.
On earth.
Huh?
When is mommy coming back?
You forgot the milk.
What about my orange juice?
When is mommy coming back?
Uh, huh...
You're late.
Okay...Same as usual...
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
Mom, I mean dad...
Mom, I mean dad...
You get a new fence.
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
Salisbury steak.
I want a pizza.
I think I'm going to throw up.
There, okay?
Daddy?
Daddy?
Is mom ever coming back?
I don't think so.
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Yes?
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Billy.
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
Objection.
See.  That's my name.
Wow!
Is this really your desk?
Did mommy ever see this?
No, son.
Mom--I mean, dad?
Was there apple juice when you were little?
Daddy!
Objection!
Objection!
Objection!
Sustained.
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Objection.
Objection!
Objection!
Objection, your honor.
No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
So do I.
Objection, your honor!
Objection!
Ted was a good worker.
There might be something at J.
I don't recall.
Somewhere in between.
Is that...permanent?
Whom you've seen twice in a year?
I was not a failure.
Were you?
Look, it's not your fault, okay?
Ted, you're not listening to me.
Where are you going?
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
How's the new job?
Look at us, Joanna.
I've seen him.
He looks like a terrific kid.
Joanna, go be a mother.
Okay, I'm here.
Ted, will you take it easy?
Hey, what's the rush?
Wow!
Jesus Christ.
Listen, don't let it get you down.
'Night, Jim.
What the hell is this?
All right, Jim.
Disappointing.
Hiya, Phyllis.
Yes.
Kramer, I've got to go.
And?
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
O'Connor's out to get you.
You want to know why?
How should I know?
So...what's so terrible about that?
And?
What?
Mr.
That's if we win.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, Christ!
Ted?
John?
What?!  She wants what?!
You ever see her talk to the walls?
Your boy is very lucky, Mr.
Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.
Hostile?
Two.
What are you going to do?
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
You ever think about getting married again?
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
She ever ask about me?
Thelma, if I die--
You heard anything yet?
Ted.
Hey, that's terrific.
Huh.. .Hello?
We must go, Holiness.
Please, come, Holiness.
All quiet?
I worry about them.
Mama, my story.
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
And that day, your father got better.
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Not the way to talk to people.
I do, now.
Goodbye, Kundun.
You must also do something about the public meetings.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Dalai Lama.
Very complicated, Holiness.
And the United Nations? Surely?
Yes.
Ngabo did not have the state seal.
Holiness?
Oh, no. Where will he go?
Your father had been very sick.
You did.
I will be back in a few days.
This many?
Who am I?
I need to squeeze this brain.
How big is Tibet's army?
Will we be in this war?
In the Pacific Ocean.
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
What can I do?
I need to know what you know.
The war is over.
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
What is the size of our army, now?
Has anyone died?
One country did sponsor the resolution.
It is unlikely.
I am scared.
Did you ever doubt it?
Land reform is underway in Amdo.
I have always asked for plain information.
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
They will take Lhasa next.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels.
Good day.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments.
I have news.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo.
Do you think I must?
This little brother was terribly sweet.
What does the butter spot feel like?
I have more men.
Things change, Kundun.
I want to go down there.
We have enemies.
This is Britain.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
Why is this?
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
You will not come?
Tell me.
Don't eat all those sweets.
You are in great danger.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
Did you love your husband, before you married?
No.
You killed him.
He just <u>appeared</u>.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
I haven't broken any laws.
Ma'am.
Ma'am, how could you not report this?
Murders and rapes in the cities.
I'll sue you.
You're a beautiful woman.
It seems like we're getting lower.
C'mon Hector.
<u>Please</u>.
I might get a shot.
Go!!!
I really don't mean to be discourteous.
Around here.  Yeah.
We'd only just met.
We are here on official business.
You listen to me.
Jesus Christ!!
Again.
Is this a trick?
Was he a good man?
His head was just... bitten off.
This is a setback.
Promise you won't kill me, first.
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
What's that?
Just spit him back out.
I can arrest you!!
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
No!
Where is he?!
No way.
And again.
I got something on the screen.
Where?  Where?
Almost here, Hector.
Where is he?
<u>No</u>.
You take care.
Hector.
If he's here, I'll find him.
Such the flirt.
He was an Indo-pacific.
<u>Jack</u>!
With crocodiles... everything's even.
What?
And how would we neutralize him?
I'm okay.
You're gonna be okay.
He's gonna live?
Kelly Scott.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
Excuse me.
How big do the bears get?
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
Why are you here?  Really.
I'm not making it up.
Oh my God.
In Maine?
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Baby crocs?
What are you doing?
That was an awful thing to say to me.
Okay.  We're up at six.
He thinks they're what?
They respond pretty quick.
You okay?  Kelly?
<u>Are</u> you okay?
Like little children.  You okay?
Sorry.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
That's why you're here.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
Well.  Goodnight.
I'm gonna get ticks.
Thing we can lift it?
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
What?
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.
Are we crazy?
It can't work.
He doesn't seem to be swimming.
He's mooing.
Watch out!!
Hector!!
We gotta get to Hector!!
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Get him onto shore.
Well...
You sure?  I don't mind...
If I'm ever in New York...
It was... something meeting you.
Different worlds, Jack.
We set?
I'm ready when you are.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
What's that?
Hank.
You said nobody came in here!
Get back from the shore.
Now I'm gonna puke.
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
If you get a safe shot...
He's done.  He's dying.
Thanks for your help.
He just came up screaming.
I wouldn't.
What?
You're sort of a rude person.
What is with this lake?
What?
Hey!!
With what?
They don't believe her.
You hurt his feelings.
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
What was that?
Are you alright?
Hank?
Are you okay?
Hank!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
They're coming right in.
Did you get him?
Should I?
Kelly.
Hi.
I had a great time last night. Again.
That's not what you came to say.
Oh.
Hey.
Sorry?
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it?
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
<u>You</u>?
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
What'd I do?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
You missed Fourth Amendment law.
Boy, is that smart...
No. He won't come after me.
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio.
"- every day."
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight.
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
Mr.
Do you need a police escort, Starling?
Not to my knowledge.
Okay, Miss Starling?
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Mr. Yow?
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel.
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Yes, well.
Now.
I've read your interim memo on Lecter.
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
Talk about him, Starling.
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
What do you see, Starling?
I don't know.
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he?
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford?
I lied to Lecter.
Ohio is cold ground.
Sir, that's great news. But how -
This Gumb's a real beauty.
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
That expires in one week.
Now then.
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
You see a lot, Dr.
I would not have had that happen to you.
Your bleeding has stopped.
Punishment, you see.
I was your choice, Dr.
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center.
Go, Doctor.
That's enough, I think.
Dr.
Not "just," Clarice.
I heard a strange sound...
What did you do?
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Where were you going?
You still wake up sometimes, don't you?
Brave Clarice.
Starling.
Examination and interview materials are confidential.
What...?
Yes... I did.
Senator Martin...!
Time, Pilch! My move.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
My God, you've grown up.
Are you alright?
Why didn't you bury those people?
You were acting for our benefit.
The Ottawa are gone.
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters.
You are right, Mr.
Much further?
Mr Poe?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
They're going to hang you.
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.
What is it?
Are we safe?
In this there is a chance.
Listen.
And my compliments to you...
Will you go back to England?
Where will we go?
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!
Will you consider that?
My God, Alice.
One called Magua arrived.
I see...
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.
Yes. Go ahead.
... compliments, Mr.
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.
How far is it, scout?
I ain't your "scout".
Who were these people?
How long?
Head for... for the white water.
Where do we go from here?
Any powder?
What did you say?
You do what you want with your own scalp.
That we did.
So what is it, Jack?
Got a reason to stay.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
I'll have none of that!
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
What happened to you?
What a place for them...
Webb's not in Albany.
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
This is the signature of Webb.
Sir!
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
First rank! Second rank! Present arms! 
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Sergeant Major!
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
Right - about face!
We must.
Gold could be arranged.
What is enough?
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
My son has been sadly injured.
Such as...?
The honors of war?
Qui vive?
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
You mind if I take a look at this?
What do you want me to say?
What's wrong?
Dead?
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
They found this?
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Be careful with it.
DeJesus!  A readout!
Doc eat already?
Bullshit.
We're getting out of here just in time.
It's got Hazy!
I thought they were your friends?
No, it's not going through.
Jesus Christ...
I hit it.
Go on!
Where the hell've you been?
Your suit, Becky!
Look at my foot, sir!
You did good...
I need more light on that, Four.
That's great.
Sixpack?
That was a loud one wasn't it?
How's astronaut training?
What can we do?
Shit!  He sent them all.
They know, don't they?
What are you doing?
We're on backup air.
We made it!
It hit me!  Where are they?!
The internal monitors read normal.
What about our quota?
Something wrong, Cobb?
Excuse me, sir...
Shut up, all of you.
No!
Oh, God, she's out there...
Charge set?
I'm going inside.
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
How do you feel, DeJesus?
Okay, number 23's full.
Thank you, Martin.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
What're you saying?
Forty-eight hours!
Made your million, yet?
You got money in this tub?
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
Personal effects...
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
If he had his blinkers on--
Who else...Sixpack.
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
Yes sir...
What the?...
You read Russian?
Bullshit.
What happened?
Still bothering you?
No way, Mister Beck!
Listen to it for Christsake.
So that's all you do?...
Oooooh.
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
"Routine," my ass!
At least we get time and a half.
What's going on?
You let him get away!
You guys are crazy.
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Hey!
It's Sixpack!
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Typhoon?!
Serves his ass right to get it.
How'd you do that?
Getting some food.
Look.  Water.
How far away is she?
Excuse me, sir.
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
Fuck semantics, Doc!
Clear for pickup.
What is it?
No.
Who were you talking to?
What on earth's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
It needs blood?
Cobb's cut...It was in him!
What is it?
What is it?
The shack...
Don't spend all day down there.
Are you sure you saw something?
Are you okay, Jonesy?
It saw us!
My pocket.
Bitch!  Look what you did!
What's wrong, did you miss me?
I'll kill him!
How much did you part with?
A what?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Drachmas, I hope.
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry.
Yes?
Of course you will, sweetheart.
Bacon, see what we got.
I think he's still alive.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface.
He'll care all right.
Well?
What's that?
Like what?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
There are no others.
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
Er, very nice Harry.
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
So who's the Guv?
I hate these Southern shites.
JD.
The boys had 'em.
Have you counted the money?
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Did I say speak?
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
Son?
You all right back there, mate?
What are you doing?
How long has he been in there, son?
It's not him, Dad.
That should take care of that lot.
Yeah?
Who was that?
We gotta get those guns.
I want you to search the house for bugs.
Dog, I have found the cash!
So do you know these geezers well?
What's that idiot doing next door?
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
It must be this one.
Yeah, one of them's out.
My neck, Dog.
J, what's going on out there?
Right, his leg's going now.
Where?
Invitations.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
What was that, armed?
Where the fuck are they going?
No I fucking don't!
That's it all done, we are off.
I hope this is the right move.
You what? What are you on about?
Well, what's going on?
There's nothing in it!
Who's this fat man, then?
What do you mean?
What the hell are you doing here?
I dunno, but they look nice.
Everything all right out there, Tom?
Well, what did he say?
You and me, Tom.
Tom, this is our case.
You got it all?
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
I will.
I think I would rather just turn them over.
That's if I want to see you.
I'll see ya.
That you, boy?
Go on.
Hello, can I help you?
What are you talking about?
How much did you say it was, Tom?
Not normal weed.
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Look. Go on, look.
What have you come as?
What you telling us for?
Oh, you assume, do ya?
Where did you get those from, a museum?
What's left over?'
The money, the gear!
What are you carrying, Willy?
You jerk--
I don't know what the big deal is.
It's my life.
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
Well?
Why don't you start with that?
So you knew this young man before?
Sergeant Major?
Out of the Army?
We're not running a dating service here.
Private Johnson!
Sam the Man.
How's business?
That the word on our boy?
What's that for?
It's your deal.
Whole different story; isn't it?
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
350 pounds.
Hey, it's the General.
You've been in this house for a while?
Where'd he get all this?
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo.
So how come you got into all this?
Dad--?
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
Homework?
How's your room shaping up?
Are we going to ever see your father?
Recycling, right?
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line?
This place is a gold mine.
What?
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
Since I've been stationed here?
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
Hey, Mikey--
You spoil 'em, Cliff.
So where does that put us?
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s.
Treasure hunter?
--warning.
There's not that much down here, Colonel.
I sprint the last quarter mile.
Black Seminoles?
That where he was shot?
This here's Carolyn.
So.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Hola, amgio.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
Reputation?
Donde esta?
No puedo ver la orilla!
Como se llama?
Es muy lindo, su coche--
Senora Cruz?
What are you doing out there?
Enrique!
No!
This girl is a friend of yours?
Rapidamente!
Sam!
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
Tell that one, Hollis--
"Mas cerveza por favor."
Your mother was a saint.
Historic occasion, isn't it?
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
When we backed you--
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
That so?
Never heard from him again?
Oh--he come to an accommodation.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
Besides my father, I mean.
Morning, Hollis.
Fellas.
Imonna find out one way or the other.
We're building up tourism, Sam--
There was a mandate in the last election--
There isn't money allocated for that.
Steve called for you.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
Mami, how old were you when my father--
There must have been somebody.
Mrs. Bledsoe?
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
I don't think you can take it personally--
I'm not open. We were just talking.
Mom?
What's she singing about?
She finally got in--
Can I get this?
Morning, Sheriff.
Your father never bothered me about it.
That's how I ruined my stomach.
Something wrong?
I was--I was real sorry about Nando.
He's all yours.
Field trip?
Your mother still doesn't like me.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
Your boy, there--
So why did you come back here, Sam?
I should get back.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
Wow.
How long have you lived here?
It isn't.
I'm not having any more children.
We start from scratch--
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
You're out early.
Sam?
You think we need a new jail?
Excellent performance, my friend.
You're the one who's a good boy.
Don't mind him, Sheriff.
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff.
What's this I see?
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
Buffalo chips.
I know you?
How come you don't took familiar?
You going to tell her?
Mister D'Amour?
Yeah?
Hello, L.A.
I gotta be careful.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
Billy?
I could have lost my fucking hands.
That's Butterfield...
Take a look at this.
Maybe they're not tricks.
Hokey enough for you?
Thanks, Billy.
How'd you spell that again?
Right.
You did.  Didn't you?
Who did this?
Who did this?
I saw him on T.
I don't want him getting in the way.
Please.
I'll tell you.
Anything?
If you've lied to me to me --
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
Jesus.
Like the look of these?
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
He's with us...
Ever watched a man die?
So do you.
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
I want you to help me help my husband.
What's the connection?
He's a secretive man.
You don't believe me.
Sorry.  You asked.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
He's good.
Are they treating you okay?
How did it go today?
They were jealous of him.
So why did you marry him?
Flesh is a trap.
What did you find?
Oh Christ.
Nix ran some kind of cult, right?
So Swann was performing magic.
It's okay.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
I was so afraid.
I was twelve.
What was that?
Are you all right?
Harry?
Oh God!
I've got to help him.
No!  No!  No!
... oh... God...
Don't look.
Harry?
Is it finished?
What the fuck?
Valentin?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
It's better he's gone.
What about me?
Bad show last night?
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.
What were you doing up there?
Where the fuck is he?
And this Butterfield guy--
Are you finished with me?
You believe that?
Trickery and divinity.
They weren't worth a damn.
You tell me.
I'm not saying another word.
With what?
Great accent, by the way.
Shit.
Whose is the car?
Havanas.
Any movie stars buried here?
Who is she?
What the fuck are you doing here?
I want to speak to Dorothea.
I can't let you in.
Leave her alone --
Are you satisfied now?
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
I want to see Swann face to face.
D'Amour --
Him too.
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
Jennifer's been with us four years.
You need an ambulance.
My God.
Hold on.
Where'd you learn that?
You know Vinovich?
I only wear ties for funerals.
Are they all in the business?
That's what they call the Repository.
Look, Ma, no wires.
You know, it's such a fucking waste.
So Nix won't come looking for her?
Oh Jeez.
You think I'm an asshole.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
They got here before us.
... no...
That's where we're all going.
This is where we killed him.
He did something with the ground.
The case is closed.
Have we met before?
Why's that?
He's not!  He's not!
Nix! Nix!
Don't touch me.
Swann?  What are you doing?
And?
You could still help me do that.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
Hello?
What are you doing here?
What about you? Why are you here?
Hi again, how's it going?
Oh, hi.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
I don't want to go home.
Hello?
Of course.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Hans was very attentive to you.
Do you remember when we met at the bar?
Did I scowl at you?
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
I know.
You made it.
It's for my daughter.
Nice one.
What happened to your toe?
It's bad isn't it?
Where's your husband?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
What do you want to drink?
So, where'd you go today.
I'm sorry.
When are you leaving?
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Charlotte?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
You're leaving right now?
Why are you crying?
Mr. Harris?
Mr. Harris?
My stockings.
Lydia?
Yeah, its really different here.
Hello?
Hello?
I guess she's busy.
Ok, well, travel safely.
Hello?
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
Hello? Yes?
Evelyn Waugh?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
How'd it go today?
No, what are you talking about.
I don't know what to do.
You smell weird.
Like popcorn?
Hair stuff?
See you later.
Yeah.
Do you think it's done?
Will you please stop smoking?
Oh, the record company sent these...
Are you sure you want to stay?
I miss you.
Lauren?
John! What are you doing here?
Uh..thanks.
Oh no...
I missed you.
How'd your interview go?
You never said anything to me...
Shi.
Peter, where are you?
What?  That's horrible!
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
I'm still shaking.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
There you are!
What're these?
Honey, you're exhausted.
She's been stalking you, Peter.
What a...jerk!
Nonsense, it's all of our home.
...you wearing a watch, Father?
Yes.
George, come in.
I can take care of myself.
Mr.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
The patient was in great distress.
Is he going to be okay?
I've had it.
You'll do it?
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
What is it?
You fucking bastard.
Why are you doing this to me?
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Father!
So...we won?
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
So I guess Satan lost.
Father, please don't die.
Two negatives always make a positive.
Oh my God!
May I help you?
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
A narcissist doesn't admit it.
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
So...what did you think of the tape.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
So what'd I miss?
We need to talk.
Why did he try to kill me?
And the point is?
I don't understand what's going on.
Do you know your parents' blood types?
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.
What are you looking for exactly?
We needed to know all we could.
Nothing yet.
Get up!!
Peter, let go of the chair!
You okay?
There's nothing else here.
Are you alright?
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
Close call.
Plenty of time.
What can I do?
I'll be all right.
He was trying to tell me something.
How much time do we have?
Oh, Peter.
Good seeing you again.
Hello?
And what are you thinking we should do now?
It's useless...look at him.
You don't want to face it.
But she worships you.
You know what?  You can go.
You do know, don't you.
I plan to.  You want a tip?
Yeah.
Good of you to stop by.
Would you sign it for me?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
What's this?
What's the matter with you?
He could see me.
Thanks for handling this.
Thanks again for everything.
What's up?
Monica, what did you do?
Ah, Mom.
I hate it.
nothing.
That's not funny
Taste this.
What?
What?
Monica.  What are you doing here?
What?
Hi.
Yeah.
So what do I do?
So that's why we can't get along?
That's all you cared about.
What are you talking about?
Which one for tomorrow?
Okay.
So you're still breast-feeding?
Well, thanks again.
Oh, me too.
I can take it.
What?
Coach...
What?
Can I take your coat?
I'm an English major.  You like English?
Sorry.
My mouth is kinda dry.
That was nice.
Wait...
I'm so sorry.
Hello.
It means a lot that you came by.
Damn, girl.
So how long is this trip?
Nah.
That too tight?
You need to.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance?
I don't know how to walk in heels.
You ever been in love?
Hey, munchkin.
You shoot like a girl.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
What's up with that?
What's up?
I know.
Well, what do you know.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
Yeah, four years ago.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
You ever think about going back?
One, up.
Told you I was nice.
So...does it hurt?
So how come you could play basketball?
What do I have to do?
I think we gotta kiss now.
I want to ride my own bike.
I don't have to do what you say.
What?
Way to hoop.
What's that?
That's it, give it your best shot.
See you made it.
Hey.
Early night for you, isn't it?
Mulholland Drive.
Why?
Four.
When'd you get this?
What was that about?
You finish the reading for E-con?
What?
It's okay, little baby.
Forget Tonya Randall.
That was so weak.
So how about a little one-on-one?
Give me the ball.
Kiss my booty.
Yo, where's the "D"?
I won.
Nothing.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Hey.
Sorry about your game.
he's just playing, Q...
Who was that?
Hey.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.
Can we talk?
What?
When did you decide all this?
So...I guess I'll see you around.
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
Just something I'm trying.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
Tried calling you a couple times.
Actually, I don't...
You visiting?
It just isn't.
It doesn't matter, alright.
What's going on?
You asked me what was missing.
I heard enough.
You haven't changed.
I'll play you.
You're out of your mind.
What will this prove?
Hey, girl.
No.
Give it yourself.
Zeke.
We should head over.
Yeah.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
Not great.
What?
What is this?
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
How was your game?
Where's your dad?
You scared me.
Guess he talked to you.
Just...leave it alone.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
What people?
Sorry.
So what are you gonna do?
What are you doing here?
From your mouth.
What do you want?
What surery?
Your teeth are straight.
No need for braces, Donnie.
You smell like trouble --
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Hello?
Hi, hello, great.
Why don't they have the same last name?
Yeah, hey. Chad.
...what the fuck is this...?
What do you want? Why are you here?
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
What the fuck do you want?
Please put your clothes on, please --
Your mother wants to hear from you --
...Hello...?
uh...uh...What is it?
OPEN THE DOOR.
...yeah...
Yes.
For what?
Wilson.
No.
You mind if I check things back here?
What are you lookin' for?
got some coffee brewing, huh?
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
Ok, ok. I'm back.
This is my job.
I'm sorry, Claudia.
Do you wanna go tonight?
Well.
....now that I've met you.
-- you the resident here?
No, what's wrong?
You live alone?

And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Are you asking me a question?

He's in here.
How long have you taken care of him?
How long...you think?
I've heard your tapes on the phone.

Hello?
Can I come in?
Want me to wake her up?
I'm sorry.
Do you still have to do homework?
Was it a call back?
Do you have an agent, Stanley?
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
They look pretty smart, I think.
You have to go, Stanley.
You don't want any water?
Let me call you a car, Linda.

My Queen...
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
Mother -- ?
What is it, mother?
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!
Louis, please -- !
What had you to do with this, Mother?
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
Your Majesty...
Wh-- Wha--
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
What do you propose to do?
It can.  I know the way.
What are they doing?
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.
The Prison of Belle Sur.
What is that?
Prison was horrible but it was his home.
Who is he, Aramis?
Switch?
How is he?
Go on.
Now.  You were saying?
Hang himself?!
Poor Phillippe!
Where are you going?!
Aramis, this will never --
Bloody hell...
He seeks redemption.
Then to the Bastille.
A simple theological discussion.
Look at us.
No!  Stop --
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.
I cannot betray Louis.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
D'Artagnan.
Forgiveness.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
Where are we?
Mother of God!
And why are you so glum?
Aramis!
I don't understand.
You've been moping for months.
Coming?
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
But what if something extraordinary happened?
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
Can we eat... before we go?
D'Artagnan.
He gets one day of confession each year.
What do we do now?
D'Artagnan, unready?
What choice is there?
It worked!
Do I look all right?
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
That must be Raoul!
But -- are you sure?
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
D'Artagnan!
It's been too long.
Thanks, but not for me.
This cannot be.
You knew this was happening.
Athos, please...!
Where are you going?
Athos!
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
Recent hours have been a shock.
You look so sad.
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
These rooms are yours.
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
Phillippe...?
One for all.  All for one.
All this time.
Are you hungry?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Your Majesty...
Aaa!
Betrothed?  I think not.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.
I just left the garden, it was empty.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty...?
I want all these passages sealed!
I was told this impostor was dead!
Where is Michelle?
Continue.
Wait.
Phillippe!
You dead yet?
Food, moron.
What number did you tear out?
You've... memorized...?
Did they kill him?
Who was Athos seeking?
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
Magnificent valor...
Riots?
Ah yes, the riots.
Sire!  I -- How did you --
From Raoul.
The food doesn't please you?
You are beautiful.  You know you are.
Shall I leave?
Did you know... about Raoul?
I will order a Mass for his soul.
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
Captain Doyle?
What can I do for you?
Alright, we know who we're looking for.
You mind if I ride with you?
It's Marvosa -
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
Yeah?
Bullshit...
You can cut the shit, asshole--
What the hell happened?
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
Don't take any chances.
Did you hit him?
What did the six-toes have to say?
Find out for me.
Let's roll -

Something wrong with you Marvosa?
Alright, where is she?
Anyhow.

Did you read today's paper?
Something I don't already know?
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Where is he?!!
Speak of the devil.
Captain?
So where are you from?
No...
Mind if I turn out the light?
You always carry a gun with you?
What's going on here?
Why did you set me up?
And what did you do?
I had it all on tape...
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
What?
Tubbs, it's me.
You are drunk.
Holy shit -
No...
And?...
Jimmy, do you realize what you did?
Oh man...what happened?
I've got a better idea...
Donut?
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?
Ahh, shit.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy.
Are you going to be alright?
Where are you going?
I'm stranded out here.
Where did you learn to fight like that?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
You don't seem afraid of much.
No - that's not it!
Where am I going?
Don't you guys ever knock?
Long gone, huh?
What about him?
Crawford has a proposition.
What have we missed?
Sidney: I don't understand him.
In thirty-five minutes.
How long do I have?
No.
This is Chester here.
Let's go to bed.
Will.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
Jack, this is Graham.
A cat.
For Christ's sake, why?
Is it weird?
Who did he ask for?
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?
Sarah, order a chopper.
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler.
Twenty-five minutes.

Who is it?
You got the message Lecktor called...
He's a very shy boy...

It does, doesn't it?
Parking permits...
Fogel has four more names.

I'll probably go back to it someday.
That was nice of you to think of that.
Is that you. D?
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
Reba...
Who is it?
Am I alone in this room?
Two groups of people were changed.
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE.
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS!
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
What am I doing here?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Look at the screen.

Do you see?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
You did very well.
Come in.
Do you have it?
Dr.
I want to see Lecktor now.
It's Will Graham...
Can you read it to me?
In a holding cell.
Linda King's desk.
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
Do you know something about that?
He's very strong physically.
To yourself...
What the hell can I do?
Molly?
Hello, hotshot!
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen.

How long would they let me sleep?
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi.
Oh dear!
You're so proud.
That means it was a success.
They're having a laugh...
We were just trying to push the envelope --
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks.
No, it's true.
What was that all about?
You must take a little pleasure in it.
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.
So how can I help you...?
I don't care about the money.
I can't move my arm.
My hair is coming out.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
What do you want?
Maybe I should talk to the natives.
But I've got a sports show.
B-but... we saw... your neck...
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!
Five.

Why did you call me?
Hi...
Popcorn?
Andy, the theater's that way!
Why did you call me?
Oh!
Why Memphis?
And all this will be for real?
Ooo, the little lady's upset.
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
Go away.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
How can you be so casual??!
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.
Go to commercial, man!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
Hey Andy, good show.
I'm gonna quit.
Give me the book.
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman?
Look at this!
Sir, do you have a problem?
I was very original!
This is great.
Are you at peace with your family?
Excuse me, Andy...
"Philosophically"?
Please!
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.
Really?
Look -- I gotta be clear with you.
Gene, you misunderstood!
"Burlesque"?
We had a deal!!
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
Can I help you with something?
That was a really hot house!
I'm worried about Andy.
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Hey, that's good!
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Is he in his room?
I saw Michael!
Hmph!
What's in Memphis?
Why is he saying these things?!
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
Sure...
A -- a tourist.
Then the informant is real.
We'll need a search running.
They are dead.  In either case --
You don't know.
The sewers.  Of course.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Lieutenant?
I sent two units.
He's gonna make it.
Weird.
What?!
Who is it?
You're two hours late.
You got the money?
Hallelujah!
Something wrong, man?
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
Don't be ridiculous.
Do you?
Did you hear that?
Are you sure this line is clean?
There's something about him, isn't there?
Hello, Trinity.
You are a beautiful woman.
I'm tired, Trinity.
But you're out, Cypher.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
... yes.
I don't believe it!
Whoa!
Is that...?
Do you always look at it encoded?
Why you're here?
Thanks... for the drink.
Operator.
There was an accident.
I know.
All right --
I got a fibrillation!
We found him, Trinity.
Give me your phone.
What is he doing?
How long?
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Hello?
Morpheus...
Holy fucking shit!
What the fuck do they want with me?!
The cubicle across from you is empty.
Good.
No!  It's too far away.
No way, no way, this is crazy.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
Do you still want to meet?
Welcome, Neo.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.
Let me tell you why you are here.
... am I dead?
What are you doing?
Why do my eyes hurt?
Morpheus, what's happened to me?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
This isn't real?
We have only bits and pieces of information.
No!
Get some rest.
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
How did I beat you?
I know what you're trying to do --
Do you know why you didn't make it?
I thought it wasn't real.
This is another Matrix simulation.
Do you understand, Neo?
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.
What?
Set down in there.
Did you believe in them too?
Listen to me, Neo.
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
How is he?
Got it.
Tank.
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
I'm going to make the call.
How...?!
Hello?
That vase.
I said don't worry about it.
You're cuter than I thought.
So?
What's funny?
Hello, Neo.
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
How did you do that?
It's the question that brought you here.
What the hell is this?!
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
What is this thing?
Uh-oh...
Get this thing out of me!
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
God...
What does that mean?
Did you go to her?
Are you all right?
What did you just say?
What is it?
Go!
Is Morpheus alive?
What happened?
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
That I would have to make a choice...
What are you doing?
No, you... have to be.
What?
What are you doing?
No one has ever done anything like this.
Neo, how did you do that?
Are you all right?
Can you fly that thing.
Morning.  Did you sleep?
You don't have...
Holy shit!
See who?
What are they doing to him?
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Neo, this is loco.
Okay.
Operator.
Which way?  Which way?
It's locked.
Operator.
Yes.
We need an exit!
Tank, you're hurt.
There is.  We have to pull the plug.
Operator.
Neo!
What just happened?
They've burned through the outer shields.
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
What are your plans?
No.
No, all we got is $40.

Not at all.
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
I've got to go --
You said you liked me.
...We know so little about each other.

Hiya.

My wife.
How long have I been here?
What makes you think he's my friend?
Shit. Wrong room.
This isn't your room.
This was your room.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
What?
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
I like your car.
Jimmy?
You're making a big fucking mistake.
Why?
You think you can bargain with me?!
You don't remember me.
Please call me Leonard.
Yeah.
You know him?
Have I told you what this man did?				*
I wrote an address in there, too.
They treating you alright?
Sleep okay?
Calm down.
How do I know he did that to you?
You decided to help me.
It's not easy to be calm when -
His name was Jimmy.
What do the police think?
Kill him.
Who?
I did exactly what you told me.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
What's wrong?
You don't know, do you?
What happened?
Neither do I.
Don't talk about my wife.
Calm down.
Yes.
Don't say another fucking word!
* Depends on if he's here in town.
They're not looking for him.
How did they explain what you remembered?
On the house.
My wife.
Beer, please.
There's a dress code?
You tell me.
You're the memory guy?
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I can't make new memories.

How can you read that again?

You really want to find this guy?
Discount Inn.
Why are you here?
You don't know him?
I don't think so.
Natalie? Natalie who?
We've got to get him out of here.
It must be his.
So was he scared?
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
So what are you gonna do now?
Who the fuck are you?
Unfinished business.
Why's that?
What do you mean "bad news"?
She's gonna use you.
She has no idea who I am.
Happy now?
My wife's death.
Yes, I do.
I didn't sell -
How'd you know I was in here?
Why?
Envelopes?							    *
You're not coming?
What's wrong?
I don't know.
This is a drug deal?!
He knew about Sammy.
I was wrong!
My wife wasn't diabetic.
She wasn't diabetic.
So who are you saying he was?					*
You probably.							 *

We're not certain...
Not anymore.
You need to consider a few issues.
I don't know.
So...?
I thought we had to meet the Man.
We want it back.
What's "nothing"?
What do you like to drink?
How fast does that go?
So where's the best place for mojitas?
My cousin is the harbor master.
Were you born in Havana?
Your father?
How's he not your husband?
Mojitas...?
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
Blanca.
You know how improbable this is...?
Like...?
Hola, chica.
I forgot the napkins.
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
Something like that.
Would you find me...?
...in the morning.
Yero, by himself?
If they attack you...
What are you going to do with me?
No part of it wasn't real.

So what do you want?
Get into business with this crew, identify them.
From whom...?
Who said, "go exploring"?
Out of...?
Control your men.
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
Yeah...?
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
I gave up nothing on you guys.
Where are you?
How'd they get onto you?
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Oh, good...
C'mon, man!

Who are you talking to?
So?
You okay?
Okay...see you soon.
You mean with the flowers...?

Why?
I think Jos suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.
I run down the numbers.
And as an investment in the future...
Conveyance?
That sonofabitch!
It's all bullshit.
So lay it out, my brother...
Equipment?
And violence is extra.
What do you care?
Then what were we talking to you for?
This the load you lost a while back?
I walk into Neptune's house.
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...

He's got taxi fare.
You think I'm lying!
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
There's an E in MONEY.
Cut it out.
That is one hell of a shirt.
Shee-it.

Let's see how you look.
What's in your socks?
You keep the sixty-four cents.
Listen, keep away from me, hear?
You don't seem like no fag...
What for?
I want you to stay, okay?
You ain't got a chance in hell.
Hey, you're good!

Well, this thought just struck me.
You got a comb?
Well, I made it.
Tell her, Ratso.

But thanks.
Okay.

Hey, what the hell you doing?
Thanks, Joe.

Three, four thousand.
Got a family back there?
Girlfriend?
How's it feel?
Just Erich.
Feeling all right?
New people sometimes get on his nerves.
And you?
What they give you?
How much did you have?
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy.
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.
Hello, Billy.
What's wrong?
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT!
You gotta be fucking crazy!
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.
You got your stuff?
Okay?
What time is it?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
We go back.
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.
Yeah I got it all worked out.
What?
Max, sit down.
Hishradyo.
Just got some news on Bell.
Why the suit?
I think I've been poisoned.
Never was anybody like you...
Billy, what's the matter?
Susan - forget it.
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
Know what?
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
What'd the Prosecutor say?
Lawyers?
His name?
What lawyer?
Hey, you can't...
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Internal hemorrage.
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
Peter...
You all watch your step.
There's really people living down here?
Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
Show that to the station manager.
Go left.
Look, I showed you my badge...
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
For Chrissakes.
We'll be back at the platform in...
Did you see the size of that thing?!
Oh, that's gonna work.
Any luck?
You said those cables're still live.
For Chrissakes, what's the problem?
I only got...
Wait a minute-
Its muscles are locked.
You feel anything?
A mistake.
Is there a switch?
Can we get this car there?
The kid...
He's special.
My God, what the hell are you...?
What are you doing down here?
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
What's Manny doing?
What are you putting that crap on me for?
But the power...
It would take a minute or so.
He didn't do it!
Which way?
We're no leaving you!
Just inner chambers...
Mantids can mimic.
He's out there.
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
Do you think we did the right thing?
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
Who know?
You know where they get this fertility stuff?
Okay, meet me out front.
Thought it was my week for that.
Evolution doesn't work that fast.
Keep going.
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Honey, just leave it.
He was just doing his job.
Great crowd.
Oh, no, you were-
Ironic, don't you think?
It's me. Can you hear me?
Don't.
No, Jesus, no.
His blood!
It's no use!
Rub it on the windows!
We'll cover ourselves with this.
Don't touch it.
Oh, come on, come on!
You go first.
C'mon...
No...
Hello.
You guys have done a nice job.
You sure you didn't see one of these?
Siri, sandblast that thing.
Not a big one.
What's this?
It bit you.
This wing configuration. I've never...
My God.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
Oh, my!
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
Here.
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
You're very kind...
What's your new book called?
But what?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thank you so much.
I thought it was time you two should meet.
Yes.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
I just kept reading them over and over.
Don't get me wrong.
You.
What are you doing on the floor?
But this time I thought clearly.
You want me to burn my book?
Then light the match, Paul.
I know this is the only copy, Paul.
See, isn't this nice?
Set what up?
Misery's Return?
Yes.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
I'm sorry, Paul.
What's the matter, Paul?
What about a bee...?
Well, is it fair?
Misery's alive!
To celebrate Misery's return.
I hope you like it.
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
To Misery.
Are you kidding?
Oh, God, what have I done?
Annie, what is it?
Paul, I know you've been out.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
I know you do.
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
It WAS Windthorne.
Oh, Paul.
Yes, Paul.
Did I do good?
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
Stop--stop right here.
Could be the weight of the snow.
You really think Sheldon's out there?
Hey, Jim, what's doing?
Just leave it, all right?
People sure like those Misery books.
No, no, of course not.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
Hey, Pete.
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
An old friend.
Sorry I'm late.
I like it.
I thought you were over it.
Not everything.
I thought you were going to dinner.
Afraid he's got no choice.
Not much luggage.
Your room.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
Won't do, love.
You won.
See anything you like?
To win?
You picked another winner!
Feel like pleading for your life?
God damn it, Nyah!
Bellerophen?
Outrageous.
Nyah!
Fight a bit of a cold..
She doesn't belong here, Sean.
Oh, Hunt, please!
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
Damn.
What you got there, mate?
Well do you disagree with that?
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar.
Wrong.
It is, Billy.
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
Billy.
Before we kill her or cure her..
We're due to take off.
Range is two kay.
There she is.  I got visual.
That's it?
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
Say again.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
How're we doin', then?
Do you know me?
What are you doing here?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
- right..where is it?
Where's the bloody -
I wouldn't do that.
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Hola..
Pull over and listen to me, will you?
What's you name?
Awfully short notice..
When they've got your recruiting technique?
So where did I got right?
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
What's the population of Seville any idea?
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
But I don't have a conscience.
Before you are.
How's it going?  Everything okay?
We know him.
-- his left jacket pocket.
Where do I meet you?
I managed.
Nyah, you've done more than enough.
I want you out of Australia!
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Are you okay?
What did you think you were doing!
- you who don't have a conscience.
No.  Should I?
An idea, yeah.
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
Not yet.
- good.
Something else?
Sorry, Ethan.
No, I don't.
He was quite a man.
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
..I'm fine..and you?
It's the transponder.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Let's start from the inside out.
Now how to get in there.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
Luther, say again.
So what did he say?
A visit from an old friend.
You have Bellerophon.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
You asked for my help.
Come on!
To friends.
The man's gone black, Barnes.
That's S.O.P..
Only four more cars.
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
You knew about Jim?
Two minutes til Krieger shows.
Well Claire do you?
Satisfied?
Dont Jim.
Is he serious?
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Did we get it?
Sarah's reconsidering.
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.
You were in the car!
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
Where were you?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
What are you going to do?
The message is for Job.
Max made a deal with you?
May I come in?
It's cash.
I'm so sorry.
Kittridge...
What are you going to do?
What happened?
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Ethans right behind me.
Claire...Hey...
This is Kittridge.
Go ahead.
I dont think so.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Passport, visas - you know the drill.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Kittridge.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
What are we downloading?
May take a little time.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
Here's to  you, Luther.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
I'm going to have to front you personally.
Ha, dear boy!
What sector's the air conditioning?
Wait!
Simple game.
Zero body count.
Merci.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
That's not it.
Claire.
Sorry, am I interrupting?
Give me the God damn gum.
Jack.  Jack.
He's got it.
In position.
Higher.  Higher.
OK.
The package is in the open.
Ethan.  Hes out of pocket.
Sarah eye on the package.
Would you remove your hat please?
I thought I was going to see Max.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
How was Chicago?
You're going to use Walter?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.
Ive got a shadow.
Abort.  Thats an order.
Where are you?
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?
Kitteridge.
Jim...?
- no.
Before London.
I knew about Jim.
Arent you going to thank me Jim.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Jim, its over.
Look to your right, then back to me.
Such a nice ass.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Thirty-two and change.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Yes...  Its him.
Whats the problem.
Its working.
Oh, you're not going.
Are you ready?
No, I want to see the dessert cart.
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
Who's dead?
I don't like him.
I have no money!
I won't pay for nothing.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Where you been?
Cosmo?
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Have I been a good wife?
Okay.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Rose, pass the wine.
Hi.  Hi.
I have my eyes open.
Where's Ma?
Here.  Ti amo. 
Here.
Mona?
Oh, Cosmo!
You haven't once said you like my dress.
Why you looking around so much?
It's wrong to just let them go.
What do you want me to do?
I won't have to shoot those dogs.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me.
We're supposed to do fifty apples.
Yes!
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Why didn't he call himself?
Have you come from my brother?
Gimme the big knife!
It's wood.
Loretta. What's that smell?
This is good. Uhh...
Why?
She was right to leave me.
You don't know nothing about it.
Son of a bitch!
I can't believe what is happening.
Your blood.
What?
It's so bright.
Oh my God.
What? What have we done?
Oh yes, oh yes you did!
Snap out of it!
Hi.
Who painted that?
Thank you!
So. Where are we sitting?
They get some turnout for this stuff.
That was just so... awful!
No thanks.
What do you want to do now?
It's really cold.
What's the matter?
This is your place.
I went with you.
Why not?
Ronny!
You've gotta get outta here.
No, I'll tell him.
What the hell are you talking about?
Loretta?
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
I got things to do.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Hi Loretta.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
You don't want the fish.
You never have dessert.
What's the matter?
Have Something.
Are you proposing marriage to me?
I like this ring.
What time is it?
What about the wedding?
Ssh, it's me.
Have you told her we're getting married?
I don't know.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
And you're a big liar!
What?
No.
Will you live here?
So we'll sell the house.
Grandma was still alive.
How's the mother?
Hi.
What the hell happened to you?
What? He's in Sicily!
Do you love him, Loretta?
Hi.
What about the moon?
Hi, Loretta.
We just come from the bank.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
Lucy.
Don't fight.
Don't fight.
Don't make yourself sick.
Moving in?
Can you wake up Loretta?
So.
Maybe I should go?
Who was that?
That's it! That's the reason!
He doesn't like you.
Loretta...
I'm sure she did.
Because my mother was dying!
Yes?
Can I get another one of these?
May I presume to ask you a question?
Don't mind about me.
Thanks, comrade.
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
Ouch.
Sorry. That was rude.
Then I'd be delighted.
May I walk with you a ways?
You knew that man?
Temperature's dropping.
Good night.
I'm freezing
That's my house.
Cosmo.
Rita. Rita.
You got me.
What are you talking about, you fool?
She's got it.
We didn't know what to think.
How do you know she is a witch?
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
Burn her anyway.
There are?
I see.  Yes, of course.
Ah.
Halt!  Who goes there?
Get away!
Look!
Where does he live?
Dennis!
Please, please good people.
The same!
All right!
What word?
None shall pass.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
Victory is mine.
I'll do you for that.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Hello.
Are you sure he's got one?
What is your name?
Now what happens?
Who are you?
Nu!
Ni!
They're nervous, sire.
What with?
There!  Look!
What?
What?
We shall attack at once.
Who are they?
By what name are you known?
What?
Look, you're a busy man ...
Too late.
Where?
Je...sus Christ!
Oh, shut up.
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Old woman!
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
Well you could say: "Dennis"
Come and see the violence inherent in the system.
Sorry ...
Well?
Make a bridge out of her.
Exactly.  So... logically ...
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
He will be soon. He's very ill.
I feel fine.
I think I'll go for a walk.
That's easy!
Bring out your dead!
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
Don't be such a baby.
I can't.
Thanks very much.
Who's that then?
Well taken, Concorde!
At last!
Did you kill all those guards?
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
Do you want to come and have a drink?
I don't want land.
But, Father.
Who are you?
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
Right.
Where are you going?
The Castle Anthrax?
Well, look er, I ...
Well ...
Camelot ...
Sir Galahad!
Well, she's got a point.
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
We were in the nick of time.
Sir Gawain.
Well,  what seems to be the trouble?
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
No, no, this cannot be.
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
Hurry!
Oh!
Stop saying the word!
They're all saying the word ...
You tit.
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
I done it again.
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
So?
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
How much?
Prince Leopold?
Which one of us is she flirting with?
And she sent no word down?
What are you doing?!
She'll drop you.
What's this?
You should have someone look after you.
The place is a mess.
Won't you give yourself a rest, John?
What's your name?
Checked and locked, sir.
Hey, Barney.
Yeah, there's a good girl.
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
It's the Queen's decision.
I wish to see my mother.
What did you say?
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Gesture?
Mother....
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
Checked and locked, sir.
Do you?
Awaiting my orders.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.
Go inside at once.
What brings you here?
What do you know about the Highlands?
You sent for me.
So...?
They don't see it.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
Mr Brown.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
Mr Brown.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.
What are those?
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals.
They're ready now.
We took a nip of whiskey.
What is it, John?  John?
Must they always follow us?
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
John?
Ma'am?
I had foreseen that you would not.
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
What can we do?
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.
Then they may read about me.
I stay here because I am happy.
This is my good John Brown.
Should we take it seriously?
Gossip counts.
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
What did he want?
We're going to lose.
A fine choice, sir.
A distinct flushing around the cheeks.
Erysipelas.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Where did you find it by the way?
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
I'm sorry, ma'am?
No.
Why was I not informed?
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
Well?
How long has he been this sick?
Read it.
Who told them that?
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!
There is one other matter.
What do they want?
Ma'am?
Where is my son?
Does that thing work?
What do you mean?
You've got your ten levels, right?
What's the riddle?
How the hell did you do that?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
Thanks, Albert.
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
We vere thinking there might be tricks.
But how can it change every time?
Dead?
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Now what seems to be the problem?
Talk to me.
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
Has anyone seen Greg?
Sick?
Liar.
So where is he?
Hmmm.
Hello?
Nick...
I have to talk to you.
What do you mean by "weird"?
Can you turn off the game?
Happy?
No, wait.
See, men always do this.
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
Something's happened to them.
Because I didn't know where else to go.
It's not this weird.
Well?
Where to now?
This is like a movie or something.
Change the channel!
Then leave her.
Where do we go?
That's what I thought.
It's growing.
Anywhere.
SLIP-STREAM.
You mean we learn the rules...
Virgin sacrifices?
Jesus Christ!
You got the schematics?
I've been thinking about that.
Alex...
What are you looking for?
I don't understand.
You're not coming, Alex.
You don't get it, do you?
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
Okay.  It's West.
The clock's already ticking.
And we've still got time left.
Hey, my strength's low.
Shit...
Our time's up.
What the fuck is that?!
We can't reach that!
So that's what we almost died for?
Christ...no time...
What is it?
Listen to me, Alex.
Come on.
Go for it.
So how did you do it, Alex?
How did you get here?
Then we'll go home?
Which way?
It's the wrong way!
It's here!!!
What did he do to you?
Think!
Mom?  You're alive...
I love you, Alex.
Is...is that where we are?
A man after my own heart.
"Escape"?
So what's the scenario?
So what do you think?
This is one of our newest projects.
It means she's screwed up.
Cool.
So start at the beginning...
Adam, where are you?
Someone's shut off my money!
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
So what's the problem?
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
Howdy!
Beautiful night.
It will work out.
Yes...what is it?
I...
I guess I've come to quite a place.
No, I don't.
It's unbelievable!
Your Aunt called me.
Coco.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
Get going.
That's okay.
There was an accident. I came here.
A car ... a car accident.
My name is Rita.
Betty Elms?
Hi.
No, no, I'm fine.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
Betty.
You're still here?
Stop... just stop!
Hi.
Yes?
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
No ..........I.
No.
What is it Rita?
What's wrong?
Well...  what do you think about then?
I don't know.
The money.
Mulholland Drive.
Okay... but just...just to see.
There's nothing?
No. Just the coffee.
Strange to be calling yourself.
What's wrong with that?
"You're still here?"
"Really?"
"You're playing a dangerous game here.
"Before I kill you."
Oh, no wonder I'm starving.
Is everything all right?
Why didn't you ask him?
Don't stop!
I don't think...
Rita... I know what you're doing.
To my audition.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
You're so easy.
What's  the matter now?
It's kind of embarrassing but,
You feel it?
Yeah, they showed me
Nice wallets.
Not here...no thanks.
No.  I haven't seen any.
You must come in first place to move on !
Is that it ?
Good morning. What do you have today ?
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
Where are we ?
Why should we trust you ?
What about Matt ?
Now where do we go ?
How do we get out of this room ?
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
Come on, it works.

What's the trick here ?
So why this ?
And you believe that ?

Do you know where you're going ?

Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
NO.

Okay, NOW I'm worried.

He's the liaison for McCay.
Don't.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes.
He'll never get it right.
Stop the hydraulics.
Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.
Hand me the 3/8ths.
What's wrong ?
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Well ?
Zachory !
Thank you, sir.
That was rather.... disappointing.
I propose we consider a hostile take over.
Zachary.
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
One moment dear... 
Yes sir.
Hey, Mr.
No.
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
So who are these people with the Boss ?
How long till the drug wears off ?
What is Bruce doing ?
What was that ?
Will he make it out ?
What's next ?
Maybe you should get over fears.
Look he figured it out !
Look ! Look !
Was that the Old Man ?
There !
That is repugnant.
Thank you very much.
So what's next ?
What the ... ?

He was right behind me !
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?

Good morning.
You had to remind me?
Umm, where do you want this?
Do you still teach?
People said she looked like me.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
How did you know my name?
THANK YOU.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune.
Give us a break.
It's too bad about your mom.
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
Do what?
Okay, no problem.
Visualize a spare?
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
Maybe I should just move to China.
So you're saying...What are you saying?
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
There's still a big spot on the floor.
You were just having a fight about me.
No nuns, got it.
What does that mean?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Yeah.
What happened to Shelly?
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
I don't know if I want to.
Never heard of him. 
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
Reason? What reason?
Maybe he's wet?
Thanks.
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
Sure am, who are you?
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
Bye.
I'm glad you're here.
And she saved it.
She's beautiful.
Hi.
My mother can't have any more kids.
What are you staring at?
What's the matter?
Hi.

So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Is it okay if I drink this?

Vada?
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
Thanks
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
Thanks....
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
Getting off please.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
Look, here she is.
You ratted on my mother??
Care for a smoke?
Boy, you're really into this.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Woah, watch it!
Where are you going???
What are you doing?
It's dangerous!!
You mean,  this ring?
Never heard of her.
My mother stood on this very spot.
What's he smoking?
Hey look!
Right.
It's not his fault!
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
Maybe not.
Write me a poem?
Muh??
What's that?
Well Rose was being very thorough.
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise.
Vada!
She lives here too?
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
Lock the door.
Maybe.
Then you'll be all set.
Hi!
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Yes, what kind of arrangement?
I think this place is just fine.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
You're Nick's mother?
I'm just tired.
Go to your room.
Bye Aunt Rose.
So what's wrong?
...It's all in the hands really.
Good morning.
They're enormous, I know.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
Why not now?
Shelly?
Did it hurt a lot?
Let me hold him.

Excuse me, what about the job?
Uh huh?
You don't like it?
Harry?
Hi.
Does it make it easier to win?
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
I had a good time tonight.
Home sweet home.
Yeah.
Dance with me?
I haven't danced in.....
Rock?
What are you wearing?
Do you want to?
I ahh, better go.
How's it going chef?
Shelly?
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Well, you were pretty great!
Can we see it from the back yard?
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old!
I was born jaundiced.
Ahem.
Vada, we're trying to work here.
VADA!
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Of course not.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Dad?
Goodnight Vada.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!
Are they ready yet?
When?
When??
Yes..
I like the freak show.
I fall asleep at the wheel.
Hi Vada.
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
Did I kill my mother?
I found this.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
Hi.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J!
I paid the money.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
Who's that?
No....
Cause she's dying.
Is that your camper?
She's shy.
Who's winning?
He's allergic to everything.
Maybe black means you're happy?
Shut your big fat mouth!
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
Hi.
Big Ringo fan.
Did you read ALL these books?
Are you married?
Bye.
Are you going out somewhere?
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
I like my name.
I won, I won!!!
Vada?
NO!
Daddy??!?!?!
How old are you?
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
It's okay sweetheart.
Goodnight.
Thomas J?
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
Oh great!
I knew he wouldn't come.
Hey look at this, no feet!
At what?
No, I'm going home.
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Yeah he got away.
Your lip bleeding?
Hey look at this!
Hmmmm, interesting.
Is that your Dad?
Here.
Can we go yet?
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
THIS!! 
Woah!!
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
Got it!
Run faster they're after us!!
Jump in the water!!
Hi Vada.
Come on, let's go.
Get up!?
Why are you running away?
So now you'll have a mother.
Like this?
Just do it.
Say something it's too quiet.
You better not either.
Seeya tomorrow.
Yeah, it's in the contract.
... trouser width, this is all classic.
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
What?
Stay, huh?
You don't miss much.
Needs salt.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
No, no, the opposite.
He's the salt of the earth.
I've lost interest.
Blood oath.
You think...
He can't do that to me!
We'll never be the same.
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
Chill.
You flew all the way h...
I was devastated.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
This is my whole life's happiness.
Jesus.
Zit cream?
Elmer's Glue?
I give.
How do you know you can touch that plug?
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Two words.
I did what I came to do.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
My heart's in my throat, here.
Excuse me?
But I can't be dry.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
What else did he tell you...
Don't you have to be somewh...
It depends.
Well.
How about...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
And loving him means loving all of this.
You'll always be there.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.
Jesus, we're trapped!
It's not just clubs.
About Michael's job.
I mean, he loves his job.
But he always says...
For the twins?
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
So... one almost has to...
He'll see right through it.
Your call.
Uh, Kimmy...?
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
In one minute.
I never want to go through this again.
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?
Well.
I saw the show.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
Ex-cuse me?
They both have some growing up to do.
Is anybody watching?
I think he's been fired.
And you think he's kept this to himself.
Maybe.  I should call Ben.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
Well, you're a little early...
I've been calling for days!
Well, that's great.
And she's all wrong for me!
Well, sure.
Well, the Sox are at home.
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Please come, please.
What's the sec...
Best everything, Joe.
I just admire your maturity, that's all.
Luckily.
Every day.  She makes the bed.
Where was that, Florence, huh?
The Vespa?
Should I whistle down a cab?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got.
I guess you're right.
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
You're not eating.
It's weird being the groom.
Wow and wow.
No problem.
Big weddings are so strange.
You miss her, huh?
Don't you throw up on boat?
Well.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
I wouldn't know.
Dance card filled?
Where did we first hear th...
Takes me back.
No accents today.
Will she like it?
I'm up against a deadline.
I forgot how cute you look.
Listen up, huh?
This thing means that much to y...
The fax is from Ben, too.
Michael? What ha...
Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
What happened?
She denied it.
Michael...
Should we take a walk?
Or we'll go somewhere.
I had the craziest dream last night?
This is her family and her fault.
I asked you...
Does that make it right...
Thank God you were here.
... your one chance for true happiness?
The Big Hurt, huh?
What's up?
Jules, what's wrong...
Uh.  I saw that moving...
Actually.
Why would she come here...
I never forgot that.
You can't believe you've lost her!
Okay, we'll split up.
The kiss.
Well, the school will be here.
Because I could come...
It's not just a gag, huh?
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
It would only be, maybe, six months?
And to m...
What a sweet little picture.
Fine.
And yet here you are.
Maybe it's happy there.
You got the money?
Winifred.
You're from out of town?
Barnett, please -
Barnett?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Am I disturbing you?
I said, I've been real tired.
It's fine.
You going today?
Well, Bye, Bye now.
I'm sorry.
What do you really want?
Yes.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett.
What?
How is she?
Well, how about the shopping center?
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
You want anything?  A drink?
Well, I'm here putting together a show.
What's he running for?
National television?
Where'd he ever see us?
Okay.
Bastard
President?
It's an appearance.
You're kidding.
Yes, but we're just singing.
Howdy.
Where are you going?
Hey!
Come on. He's a crook.
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
You bet.
He's my father.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
HI.
Well, Mr. Green.
Mr. Green?
You want me to wait?
What?
Yes, sir.
I didn't think it would.
Well, don't be shy.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Did you see who that was?
Uh huh.
You know anything about the stations here?
What's this?
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died.
Have you seen a woman about so high?
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
Wrecks.
Parts.
Mom?
Weather's been awful.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Have your children been deaf since birth?
Hello.

Well...How have you been?
Hello.
Who is thin?
Hello.
Stay.
When did you think it would happen?
How old are you?
Terrific!

Are you sure you know what you're doing?
That's for sure.
Hello. John Triplette.
Oh, no.

Thank you.
What kind of pies do you have?
Naw, she don't mind.

Divine intervention.
Looked like an interview to me.
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti.
Who isn't?
Who's the song bird?
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Yeah.
How come you never talk?
Say something.
Ah.

You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Donut, get your camera.

That's what I thought.
Say it.
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.

...developed between the three of us.
Wait!
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
I can't go.
Yeah baby.
Yes.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
I admire them.
Hypnotizing.
Through the power of the simple word---
Yes.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
What do you think, Pitney?
Drink up!
How immediate is immediately?
You can't be serious?

Fill her up?
Boy - you hear me?!
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
'You Duff Anderson?
Want to keep your job, boy?
I said: Cut it out!
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
I know.
Yeah.
What d'you want?
Yeah.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Thanks.
His profession?
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
Like hell.
How 'you doin' man?
Been over to the other mill?
That's two bucks, Joe.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
Oh yeah?
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
Hell!
They must work on the section gang.
Get out of here!
Let's go, Duff.
How come you stay 'round here?
Not here, Duff.
At first it was real strange.
Ain't your fault.
Surprised?
How old is your boy?
Hi.
How did it go?
What d'you mean?
Thank you.
I can see why.
That's Bessie Hall.
Hey, watch out!
What about him?
Is that so?
What's wrong?
Everything you cook is good.
What about them?
You know how to box?
Like so.
Ain't that something?
Don't, Duff.
Don't deny me, Duff.
Yeah.
Hi.
You know - we do have enough money.
No point fixin' it!
Don't do that!
You heard me!
How come you don't hate their guts?
Duff, I love you.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
Where're you going to go?
Okay.
What you gettin' all pretty for?
Where' you goin'?
Just get her drunk.
We was just leavin', fellows.
A whole lot, Frankie.
That's right.
Good-bye, Frankie.
See you, Duff.
They all got families to support.
'See ya.
'You Will Anderson?
How about a drink?
What happened?
I asked you somethin', boy!
My son?
Take it easy, Pop.
Couldn't get the words out before.
How you doin', boy?
Want me to hold the light for you?
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs.
Seems a little loose!
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
That's the trouble with you boys!
How often does he get like that?
Come back some other time, will you?
Come on, Pop.
Want to come up the house?
Hello.
I know just how you feel, son.
So I been told.
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis.
Why don't you guys buy your own?
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
I'll be a monkey's kid sister!
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
Yeah.
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
Come on, Will.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
Is she good in the hay?
He's your son.
Now you stay put!
Got a thick feelin' here.
Let's go.
I fucking hate Raoul.
Your Raoul?
I want my wife.
I'm sorry, Danny.
Omar, your wife's here.
Whoa.
How long's it been?
We got any shots?
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry.
Let me get you another glass of wine.
Peter said you came to kill us.
Take this off.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute.
She's very striking, don't you think?
Security breach.
You're hurt...
What are you doing in here?
Can you get us into Straylight?
I'm getting used to it.
What the hell is that?
What you lookin' for, mon?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
Easy...
What's an A.I.
The Villa Straylight.
Alright. Let's talk business.
Those are all your records.
Your gun, your prints.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
I've heard about rogue A.

You should eat something - you'll feel better.
I think I better go.
You're not being fair to me.
Jesse, God - what happened?
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
Who, Jesse?
Fred Krueger.
You created him - you can destroy him.
Hi.
What's so funny?

Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
Morning.
Hi, guys.
There's a Jesse on the phone.
What's that?
We're going up to bed now.
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different?

Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Good morning, Jennifer.

I know who's trying to kill you.
So what do we do about this creep?
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
What's happening?
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
It was great seeing you again.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
I used to live in this house.
Have you ever done that before?
That man in my dreams.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
You like gymnastics?
Freddy?
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
What's that?
Nancy!
Kristen, can you pull us out?
Are you okay?
He's gone.
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.

I don't know...
You got five minutes.
Fred Krueger's dead.
I think we can stop him this time.
It's over.  It's over.
Crossed over?
Tell me about the kids.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
Ms. Thompson.
You're late.
Yes, tell us, Nancy.
This is nice.
I can't believe I just did that.
To who?
Stop blaming yourself.
You sound like Peter Pan.
Take us there, Kristen.
We can try again.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
Take it slowly.
What are we going to do?
You're not going in.
Nancy...
Oh Christ.
Neil, it's no use.
I'm Taryn White.
Who is he?
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
In there.
We've got work to do.
What was that?
Somebody else is out here.
Science...I suppose.
I could've saved them.
This wing's been closed for years.
How is he?
What did you think?
Okay, Group's in session.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.
I'm sorry, Neil.

Why is he after us?
Mom and Dad?
We're here.
I'm in.
Hi.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
Lovely to meet you.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
That was such a great evening.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
No!
God, that's an enormous arse.
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Sorry about that...
Oh Jesus.
Okay.
No.
Thank you.
Oh hi.  Forget something?

So who left who?
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

As far as they're concerned I do.
Now stop.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.
This is certainly... ah...

Excuse me.

He's bringing a girl?
That's right.
Where are you going?
No.  Not true...
Bella -- this is Anna.
Still loves you though.
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
This painting isn't the original, is it?
Bernie.
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Hello, Bernie.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Is this your first film?
By the way -- it's you.

So I get the brownie?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Well?

Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Oh my God...  Hello.

She was your sister.
May I see your boarding pass, please?
Great.
You didn't have that with you before.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
Excuse me?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
So, what's the story with your friend?
No, really.  What's she doing?
Were they pen pals?
What?...
Oh, right.
Good.
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
What?
I don't get it.
Who's dying?
I'm a liberal!
And, he's a friend of yours.

You...
Congratulations.
Lots of history.
Hello?  Is anybody there?
Damon Bradley...
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Where are you going?
That's not the point.
How could you do this to me?
You're limping.
Why can't you just tell me?
Don't you see?
Fine.
Why not?
Why?
Uh, I'd rather not say.
He's out by the pool right now.
Do you want me to do it?
Hi, Peter.
So.  You found him.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Where are you going?
Oh, thanks.
Hey--
What?...
You were saying...
Why are you doing this?
Well, what about books?
How about music?  You like classical?
You okay?
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Hi.
Yes.  I am.
Is something the matter?
I'd call that a yes.
Alright.
Really?...
And this is the thanks I get.
I was hoping for the real thing.
You're Damon Bradley?
Hello.
Been here long?
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Sure.
I'll look forward to it.
Wait.
Sure.
Well, to-- new friends.
Excuse me?
What looks good?
So what do you think?
Faith, this is my mother.
So, what are we waiting for?
I don't believe in statistics.
Scientologist.
So, you gotta be a little flexible.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
Is everything okay?
No.
What's he do?
"Thrills"?
He begged me to marry him.
Come on, it's not so bad.
But what?
Let me tell you something about love.
I understand, Kate.
Kate, is something the matter?
Have you seen him with someone?
It's a miracle.
I can't believe we did this.
No, I haven't.
Thank you so much.
You okay?
Now what do we do?
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
What are you doing?
You can't really blame him for being upset.
I just got a dial tone--
Ah ha!...
We're saved!
Your brother?
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
I'm hungry.
You expecting somebody you know?
That was a long time ago.
Anna, I'm Faith.
What did you say to her?
So what's in a name?
He's heeeeeerrre...
Faith--
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
That was really sweet...
Yeah.
Hi-iii...
No.  No, you go ahead.
Peter found him?
Amazing...
Joan Collins stayed here.
Whatareyoudoing?!
Kate.
Maybe I can change him.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
He's a jerk.
So...
Kate is that you?
Well.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
And you are?...
Oh.
It's siesta.
How old are you?
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
No, you don't understand.
Kate, you're still there?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
I came after the woman I love.
Yeah--
She what?!
I have to talk to her.
It was an emergency.
And then I saw her.
Oh, it's you.
Right now?

Easy Shirley, Easy!
The ropes are coming loose.
I've got the ropes loose now.

Shut up.
You get the key?
Leave it where it is.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
You excited?
You want, I tole you you can come.
Ironic, isn't it?
Quite a mess.
Hello?
Karen, I told you not to--
Sign says "Shut the fuck up.
Yeah, I got a problem.
How much for your company at chow?
This doesn't concern you, Foley.
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine.
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Who's sitting here?
Reggie, push off and hit, man.
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?
Soon as we leave here.
You know how to use one a these?
Good luck, Richard.
Why you're just a girl.
You comfy?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Boy, it stunk in there.
Who, Buddy?
You don't seem all that scared.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?
That part in the movie where they get shot?
You're sure easy to talk to.
Get your hands up and turn around.
You know who this is?
How'd you get this number?
My dad's retired.
It takes hours to get a drink around here.
You like bourbon?
Not yet.
Oh, God...
You like taking risks.
You really wear that suit.
Remember how talkative you were?
I hear he didn't mean to.
What were you gonna do with me?
I wasn't sure you caught that.
You know I saw you on the street.
You were going to see her?
You coming back?
I want you to know something.
You're not dumb.
You getting serious on me now?
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Detroit.
Oh, hey, Studs?
Take your sunglasses off.
Wait in the car.
Weren't you expecting us?
What happened to your shades?
Whose blood you got all over you?
I thought you guys were busted.
Some people are going out of here.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Thanks for your help.
Tell me something.
It's a little late for me.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
Gentlemen.
Foley?  That you?
Have they got Midge up there?
What do you want from me, Jack?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
<i>Hejira?
I'll send it to you at Glades.
I got a big score lined up up north.
You don't remember me, do you?
But you're sure we've met, huh?
Do we have a gun in the car?
Take the next exit.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
You there?
Watch the road, boy.
Wait a minute.
Thing I'm worried about is you.
That was some shit, huh?
Hi, Ray.
How's it going?
Foley?
You're a fighter?
What'd you fight, middleweight?
What's wrong with you?
Moselle Miller?
That's not Maurice?
You like to sit down?
Glenn?
Was a she, name Tuffy.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
It's beautiful.
Thanks, Dad.
You were talking in your sleep.
What are you thinking about?
He doesn't even look like that.
Ray's with the F.
Was it Foley?
Hello?
He waved to you?
You gonna go get him?
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
You here all by yourself?
How do I look, mama?
In case no one knows what he does.
Did you pay the guy the reward?
Thank you...
Faux goose down.
Excuse me.
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
Midge.
We have a problem here?
I think he must've fell in.
I found a rubber.
...the fuck is this...
Are you sure they're here?
What is it with Red?
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.
I wish she could forget him.
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
Do you always stutter?
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
You're Walker, right?
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Yeah.
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
Ever hear of mai-tai's?
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
They ready, Earl?
Cock-suckin' right I do!
Earl!
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
It's Germans!
Good shooting, Danny!
Didn't you say test the limits?
How could you do this?
Nah, you go on.
Sorry.
We gotta face some facts here.
How come you're not pukin'?
Don't blame her, Rafe.
She said I was so much like you.
Get me into a plane!
Where are we going?
It's tight.
They're all over us!
You hear my okay?
Land of the free.
I'm out of ammo!
Fun today.  Like old times.
Maybe just trying to measure up.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
It's not getting any longer.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
Danny...
Hey!
Lieutenant.
How's everything?
Sorry.
So beautiful!
And where's the secret base, Sir?
Good luck over there McCawley.
I heard what you did.
Is that the good new, Sir, or --
Listen you guys.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.
How'd you get this?
What's your name?
How often you fight like this?
Thank you, 'Mam.
You take care, Dorie.
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
Oh, this is Betty.
Danny's not coming?
There's one thing I have to say.
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.
It's all right.
What else can we do?
Rafe --
What?...
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
We have achieved complete surprise!
What if the Japanese did invade?
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr.
Leapin' Jesus!
I have'na been able ta --
So you join us, Admiral.
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
Hello, Lilla!
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year.
What's it going to be, Elizabeth?
Do you believe in all of that?
It's gonna rain again.
Let's go.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Do you have to wear that hat?
Where were you?
But I want you and Scott to understand.
Hey, you're a hip chick.
I feel ridiculous.
Carol!
1 just did it for the reunion.
Welcome to the singles scene.
Hi, Peggy.
The only one?
They're waiting. Come on.
Where is it?
We're going to take you home.
I'll call you Later.
I don't get it.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
All right. What's the scoop?
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Okay.
What's the matter?
Lucky lady. Hi.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Charlie really has a great voice.
Peggy Sue!
Don't be silly.
And we're here on the couch...
We're here on the sofa bed...
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
But you love me don't you?
You got a Tab?
You don't want them?
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I vant to suck your blood.
How do you feel?
Not now, Charlie.
You drive like a maniac!
It's not going to be forever.
Want me to drive you home later?
Looking good out there.
Where did you get that sweater?
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Mmm.
You know.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
I'm sorry Charlie.
What do you know about classical music?
Because nothing else matters.
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What are you doing here?
I want to know what's going on.
What're you doing here?
Oh.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Does this mean you like me again?
Forget it, it'll never work.
What the hell did you do that for?
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
Look.
What do you mean you and my father decided?
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
Oh, Charlie.
I love you.
I think we should get out of here.
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
It couldn't be me.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.
Hello, Charlie.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
We think this party might cheer her up.
Did you study for the test?
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
Hey Terry, what is that?
Terry, slow down.
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
Fine.
It was my idea, Grandma.
It was Beth's idea.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Don't get your hopes up.
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
Cool it kids.
The young man leaned back in his chair.
This is great reefer.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude.
That was quite an evening.
Five more weeks of school.
But what about the other night?
It's Charlie!
Ssh. He's great.
I thought I knew everything about him.
Young lady, you're drunk!
Damn that Charlie I
Hi, Dad.
For me?
I closed my Christmas club.
Ta da!
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Oh, you're both so naive.
Jack, take it easy.
A new car.
I don't need your charity.
Does everybody have to hear?
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Mom!
I have a note.
Chanel Number Five.
My little baby.
What happened to your hair?
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
When did you start drinking coffee?
Oh yeah.
Who was that man?
Would you get that, dear?
Peggy!
What happened to you?
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Where have you been?
I'm not the maid!
Would they go over my girdle or under?
Isn't that awfully forward?
No, just a friend of mine.
Sheerotards.
What are you doing?
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
And the butter.
Mom, sit down for a minute.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
I remember that dress.
I remember when you got that locket, too.
What's up?
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
Hello.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
I have to talk to you.
What a great kite.
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
You have a blind grandfather.
But when did you leave?
I'd be very careful if I were you.
What're you doing?
You're taking advantage of a minor.
Ah.
You don't have to use pig Latin!
Richard!
Hi, Richard.
You are completely relaxed.
No!
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Hey!
What's the matter?
I came to say goodbye.
Why are you bothering me about this?
You want some advice, friend?
Believe what you saw, Matthews.
I hear you moved into town.
That's Renee alright.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly.
I was building a doggy door.
What?
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Is something wrong?
Out?
What happened to you?
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
How long ago did this guy retire?
What's wrong?!
What's a lunch cost these days?
You nervous?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
What?
I think so.
Who was that?
Hey! Where're you off to?
Just out.
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
What are you talking about?
Geoff, this is crazy.
All set?
So where're we going?
Not that much appreciation.
Your momma's worried sick over you.
Zowie...
What's his name?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
Is this a good spot?
Come on, that's just a bullshit story.
You want me to help?
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.
How can he not have a heartbeat?
It's weird...
What was that all about?
I gotta go back and do my chores...
You ever think about running away?
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
How long have you been here?
How did it go with your father last night?
I know, Mom.
Mom...
Are we interrupting, Andy?
Yes!
Jesus.
What in God's name... ?
What was the file name?
Do you really think so, Andy?
Why, Beckett?
Thanks, Walter.
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
This time. What about next time?
Perhaps.
Excuse me, Charles.
Thanks, you guys.
Aren't you giving an exam?
It could be parasites, an infection...
Don't apologize for me.
That's the third time.
Why are you getting dressed?
You're leaving the hospital?
Jerk... What did you say?
Hold still.
What's wrong with you?
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
I'm ready...
It is, and it isn't, Charles.
Thanks, Charles.
Thanks for coming in.
I know that, Charles.
We've been talking it over, Andy.
Take it easy, Walter.
You can save it for the jury, Charles.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
This is my partner.
I'm trying to help your "partner.
Innocuous?
Client of yours?
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
New baby?
Hell, they are staring.
Big trouble.
I buy that.
Okay.
Thanks for your time.
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
Who'd you get?
How did they find out?
There is no relevant precedent.
One more thing, Your Honor...
PARRTYY!
Beckett.
I'm a law suit.
What do you want?
You think I'm uncomfortable...
You survived your first gay party intact.
Opera?
I'll look over the Q and A.
Particularly, Charles.
A regular all-American guy?
Are you a good lawyer?
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
I better get home.
Thanks for coming by.
Rach.
What kind of movies do they show there?
When?
Do you need a break?
Some do. I didn't.
Yes.
Hello?
Andy!
Gillman says I'm fine.
Hi, Mom.
Mom?
He was losing weight.
Miss Burton?
Ms. Burton. You're black.
In what way?
Objection!
Objection!
Objection!
We object, Your Honor.
Leave that.
We're going to draw blood.
The guy sat in my office!
A homosexual encounter.
Okay, Mr.
Andy.
Good school. What year?
You load the film... ?
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
How many gays do you know?
Your Aunt Teresa is gay?
Don't know, Joe.
Joe?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Right.
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
Not when I was in the Navy.
Yeah. But we took care of him.
You taught him a lesson.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
Let's continue.
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Andy.
Julius!
Wait a minute.
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
That's kind of.
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.
Very interesting, Bob.
Don't wanna miss this.
Gonna lose everybody out here....
What? What is it?
You came for us....
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Tell me that was you.
Oh, Lord....
You mean...tonight?
Liquid oxygen canisters inside.
Bottle-count.
Bring the light!
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
Tell me about the sounds.
You did this? To yourself?
Power cells.
Why, what'd you hear?
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me.
Where are the sand-cat tracks?
What do you see? Riddick?
Riddick? What the hell are you --
Canyon ahead.
What about her?
Back to the ship, huh?
How many you see?
As fast as you can.
So where the hell's God now, huh?
Tell me the settlement is right there!
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
Just come with me!
They're already dead. Get on board.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
You'd die for them?
This is it?
What do my eyes see?
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
There....
Let's move.
Hey.
Amazing. I'm Johns.
And him?
S'matter?
A very good sign.
What?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Better keep moving....
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
So now you know.
Didn't bite.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
He used that?
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Little ratty-ass.
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check.
Rag it, Riddick.
...need those cells from the crash ship.
He can pilot?
You said we were going to trust him now.
Dancin' on razor blades here...
You're not a real cop, are you?
My first run-in with Riddick.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Oh, lady.
How much you weigh, Johns?
He'll lead you over the first cliff.
So you noticed too?
We aren't completely stupid.
This does not help us, Johns.
We cannot go through there....
It's the atmosphere.
Well? Is it just the pump?
Imam.
Why did I fall on you?
Fry?
Look, Fry.
Owens!
I don't suppose....
So quiet.
One is all?
I saw the cut-marks on the bones.
Hasan?
They're afraid of our light.
Imam. Slow down.
The sled as a shield....
Oh, no.
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Well.
Where's Mr. Johns?
What're you doin'?
Suleiman!
New Mecca....
For what?
"God is Great," yes?
We crossed our own tracks.
She's the captain, we should listen to --
...then we saw this.
King Tut's tomb....
A toast to whatever he just said.
What the hell are these?
So just like that.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Very big beads.
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick.
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
My recommendation: Do me.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
I'd rather piss glass.
Think about that reward, Johns.
<u>Fuck me</u>.
Such as.
What're you jaw-jackin' about?
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Six of us left.
What's her name, anyway?
An' this?
So much for your nightfall.
Not a star-jumper.
You were tryin' to kill him too.
Take it.
Dr. Zaius --
He exceeded his orders.
How did you know we'd come here?
A doll alone proves nothing.
Seal the cave?
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
As you wish.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago.
Nothing much.
Where does the river lead?
Taylor, I'd rather you -
Yes.
That was different.
They can't convict us of that.
Do you have to work tonight?
That's Bright Eyes.
Look -- she remembers.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Now, just a minute --
'Dodge was killed in the hunt.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
'Then how do you account for me?,
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
'I am not a missing link.'
A toy.
How did it go?
We'd better get started.
Got your sensors?
Nothing will grow here .
Which direction?
Taylor -- quit riding him.
Where there's one there's another.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Will he live?
This place is dirty, doctor.
But the quota system's been abolished!
Objection.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
He can reason?
That's true, Dr.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Objection!
Yes, sir.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
What happened?
Get me a collar and leash.
Landon! Send a last signal.
It's no use ... there she goes.
Gone.
Well?
Landon! Join the expedition.
If only we could get a fix.
All right --
Straighten me out on something.
Okay.
Scarecrows?
Can we take a dip?
No cigar.
We got off at the wrong stop.
Who are you?
She comes along too.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Why did you do that?
Sorry, Lucius.
Not everything.
They think you're behaving foolishly.
Lucius.
I told you not to bring the other one.
Gorilla hunters ...
Who put them up?
What is that?
Yes, Sir.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes.
One is in a museum!
You destroyed his memory!
Sustained.
Thats a lie!
This is a joke in very poor taste.
How so?
Sustained.
What about me?
Stop right there.
There is no contradiction between faith and science.
What is your proposal?
Tell him to pull back!
Then there is another jungle?
Why?
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
I'm not acting!
Where have you been?
It's him...Landon.
You! ... You knew about this?
Listen-
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy.
Are you going to take her with you?
What's the diagnosis, doctor?
And that's your Minister of Science.
Taylor! Tell him.
Would you like to come along?
Go with God, Taylor.
He's moving his fingers!
How sad.
Let them talk, Mr President.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland.
But the proof? The doll?
Bunker...
...but 'Lias is still out there.
Elias is dead.
I SHIT on all o' you.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
Where the fuck is red platoon!
We got boo-coo movement.
So what's the problem?
Sarge?
Uh.
Youse a pig man.
Don babytalk him man.
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
Come on you can do better than that!
You lame Taylor?
Where's he from?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Fuck this shit!
I was wrong.
Taylor! Francis!
Rhah!
La Dai!
Where's Lerner?
Come on man!
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
First time?
Feel good?
...But what'd she do?
But what'd she actually do?
Dawn! That was it!
Oh shit!
I'll go with you.
Okay - got light duty, three days.
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
No, thanks...
Yo getting there Taylor.
Must be somebody?
You volunteered for this shit man?
What we got here a crusader?
Shit!
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos.
Alright, Six says torch this place!
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
Merle?
Whew! - where that come from?
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
Right on.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
I didn't like it.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
You wanted to see me sir?
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Same as an hour ago.
You could tell me your name.
Or Reno?
Nice room.
Dine and dance tonight?
The brush-off, huh?
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Betty, this is Margo West.
I think I'd like to dance.
I think you're drunk.
What's the matter, baby?
Good evening, Miss.
They might think I was running away from something.
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
Your liquor laws..
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here.
You're not paying for this.
Neatly said.
Dance?
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
There isn't one.
No.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
Go ahead.
You tried to run away.
Want a spike in it?
Bad?
What time is it?
Cold?
Want to dance?
That man over there.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
That's the second round I've lost tonight.
It sounds like a fair location.
Cant be too close for me.
I hated to go to that place.
This is the ace, Betty.
You'll be safe here.
Well?
Killaine's wise.
See anything?
Cold?
Funny, I never thought of you that way.
In a way.
It buys things, just like any other kind.
You'll never make it.
It wasn't the time or place.
This is it, Betty.
I think you mean that.
Yes, Miss.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
Please answer my question.
Well, that's not getting us anywhere.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
What this?
Good morning, Mr.
Care for a stroll outside?
FLorida?
Down below's Stanley Park.
I'll find out, you know.
I wouldn't make you talk about it.
You won't tell me who you are?
This isn't a very good place to talk.
I expected nothing else.
I'm about to be very silly.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
He could have killed me a dozen times.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
Mr.
Nice friendly approach you've got.
Private eye?
You hurt my feelings.
There's two hundred.
Hi Margo.
Let me introduce you.
What'll you have, Margo?
I'm sorry.
All right, let's see the buzzer.
How are your teeth getting along?
What's this in favor of?
What?
That's what I like about cocktail parties.
Thank you.
Where?
Could be.
It was lying where on the balcony?
How about a cup of coffee?
How are you two getting along?
In case you want to have us followed.
Time for a little chat?
Thanks.
And old man Clarendon?
Mitchell was too drunk.
No more for me, thanks.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
What's the matter, baby.
Do me a favor, Mitchell.
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
I'm getting positively haggard.
What are you doing here?
I'm a very observant man.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
And don't get too logical, Driscoll.
Got a moment, Inspector?
We've done that.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
Mr.
I need a receipt.
You in charge here?
I knew him.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Not too hard, is it?
Was that about the right angle?
You've got a dead man on your hands.
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
How did he know he'd get the chance?
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.
May you what?
Scotch and plain water, I think.
I never saw it before.
What about me?
Remember that time, didn't I?
Yes, I think so.
No doubt about that one.
You'll have to take my word for it.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
Killaine, this is Mr.
No.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
"Superintendent J.
I believe you won decorations during the war.
Get out of here!
What'll we do about it, Margo?
I've always been a heel.
What's this?
I'm sorry.
She is beautiful.
You're very attractive, my dear.
Mr.
He's a little unhappy.
My first husband worked for the BBC.
My husband apologises for not joining us.
To Ann.
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pt.
I do worry about Susan.
Thank you.
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.
Hello.
Shall we go?
Thank you.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
Give them here.
Terrific.
Charles!
How's Mary?
Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho.
It's terribly good.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Attributed?
Congratulations.  Who with?
I know, I know!
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
So it's all worked out perfectly...
Was that your chapter, then?
Can I give you a lift?
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Everyone describes the same process.
Damn.  They're early.
Again?
Why not stay?
You don't trust me.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
I think we're ready now, thank you.
I haven't seen much of you.
Might?
Jeremy phoned this morning
Shall we have a drink or something?
Not here.
Blas and epicene.
C'mon.
Bastard.
To the Fleet.
Now, top secret file.
Uh-huh.
That's enough of that.
What have you been up to?
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Perhaps I will, then.
Still in love?
Six onion bajees!
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
Hello.
What period?
Not bad.
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Hello, Jimmy.
So how is she?
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.
I've got to be going.
I'll tell you another thing.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
It was last year.
Darling Susan.
Don't point it at James!
What have you got there?
We'll see what we can do.
It was incredible.
Don't close the door.
Ah, Susy, it...
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
Something happened.
Friends of yours, huh?
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.
Don't you gamble?
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
Football's a man-made game.
How you figure?
One shot stopping.
Ever done this before?
We gonna jump or jerk off?
Utah, you copy bruddah?
You gonna pull?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
What's this?
You're a fucking dead man--
Talk.
We're wasting time.
I can't do this.
I'm not armed.
Where's Roach?
Why should I?
Pretty radical, Johnny.
Go on, Johnny.
Three seconds... two... one...
Wild ride, huh?
Yeah?  What?
You sure he isn't out back?
You know less than nothing.
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
This is us.
How was the beach?
Three men dead.
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.
Cole and Munoz?
Look, Harp.
Harp, let me tell you something.
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Good move.
They don't go for the vault?
Surgical.
You through, Mr. Wizard?
Sorry.
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Candle wax.
Sex wax?
... Four months.
Johnny, it's the only way.
They're like some kind of tribe.
I think you gotta hit them straight on!
Angelo, pay attention.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.
Aw shit.
Johnny!
... so I started tailing him.
They're on their way to Maui.
I say we call it in.
Time for lunch.
The hell are they?!
Nothing?
I know where they're going.
Angelo!  Don't fire!
What do you want?
What is it?
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.
Stop here.
Nice place.
Who's the girl?
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies.
What's goin' on?
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
You had enough?
Look at you.
Those are cold.
I... I gotta go.
Ouch.
So what'd the other guy look like?
I work bank robbery.
Well, I saw you and--
Hey!
Bye.
Strange, Major.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon.
Wasn't my style.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs.
Billy's on it.
Mean anything to you?
I knew this man.
It was all bullshit.
She's too valuable.
You're wastin' your time.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
He'll be looking for the trip wires.
No way, Dutch.
I'll see you there.
Thanks.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em.
Take a position over there.
Any sign of the hostages?
What's got Billy so spooked?
You saw what?
We've got most of the flares, frags.
I'm sorry, Bull.
You're looking well, Dutch.
That's over the border, General.
What have you got in mind, General.
You lift off in three hours.
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
What's he got?
What in God's name...?
Georgia.
Your uncle will like this.
There's no way you could know that.
We can reach an understanding on this.
I like your hat.
It's... it's not like that.
You don't know anything about me.
What's that long building over there?
The real estate possibilities are endless.
Congratulations, sir.
Who are you going after next, sir?
What would it take to buy our stock back?
Mr. Harris.
Yes.
Stop.
I... I would take advantage of it.
I.
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
No, you look like a hooker.
Nice car.  Yours?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
What's your name?
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
No, but it's getting there.
Three hundred.
Get in.  This side.
Better believe it.
My raincoat's in the back.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Want to know something?
Let's talk some more first.
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
It's a very good year.
Try a strawberry.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
What do you like?
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?
Where'd you go?
Do you ever... enjoy it?
I buy companies.
By breaking up a company's assets --
All right.  How much for the week?
It'd cost you.
Four thousand.
I'm not just talking about sex.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Hello?
I'm sorry.
And that's the way the game is played.
You're upset, huh?
Okay.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
What about dinner?
You always been rich?
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
You still mad at'm?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
Real genuine guy.
You asshole!
What was I supposed to do?
Well, it's true.
Vivian.
Do I look okay?
What's that?
Edward, I can't.
I've never been on a plane before.
Sorry.
What else?
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
What did you do to him?
I got tired of hating my father.
You're packing.
Aw, don't... no...
I didn't think so.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
What's up, where you going?
Love this car!  Is it new?
I want to.
Edward, did you hear me?
What!?
What time's diner tonight?
Goddamit!
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
Fill me in on this.
Why do you want to know?
This is no time to disappear.
Did I wake you?
I don't think there's any sense in --
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
What!?
You broke my nose.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Carlos had some great rock.
We worked for that money.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.
Looks slow tonight.
I can't handle this tonight.
'Lo.
He... he just does.
Kit...
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
Want a pair of boots?
You sure you won't come with me?
Couple a hours.
Yeah, what?
Housekeeping.
<u>Housekeeping</u>.
Is that all?
I'm just going to my room.
What's your name?
Niece?
I got a dress.
What is it, Miss Vivian?
Miss Vivian --
Barnard Thomas here.
Hi, Barney!
May I help you?
Are you looking for something in particular?
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
What is with you?
Would you like to try it on?
Yes?
Having a good time, Vivian?
What?
Yeah.
Do you want to know what he did?
I bet.
Get out!
You don't believe me?
My Westley will always come for me.
He will come for me.
Ah!
Every ship but the four you sent.
You never sent the ships.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
I killed him myself.
Who are you?
Catch your breath.
I never said he was my dearest love.
Rest, Highness.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
Does it bother you to hear?
I asked him what was so important for him.
... as ... you ... wish...
Farm boy.
Farm Boy.
I fear I'll never see you again.
Can you move at all?
We'll never survive.
Singed a bit, were you?
Finally, Roberts decided something.
We did it.
Oh, Westley, darling.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
But it did.
I did that on purpose.
You're quick.
Why is that, do you think?
Why should that make such a difference?
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
I only dog paddle.
Faster!
You be careful.
Give her to me.
Probably he means no harm.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
Hello.
You don't look so good.
He's with the Prince in the Castle.
The Man in Black?
-- Fezzik, please --
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily.
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
You've been mostly dead all day.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Will this do?
Inigo.
He's getting away from me, Fezzik.
I brought you a special present.
A book?
It doesn't sound too bad.
-hold it, hold it-
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
Westley didn't reach his destination.
What?
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned.
Oh no. No, please.
You read that wrong.
It was ten days till the wedding.
Westley's only faking, right?
No!
What? What?
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Yellin.
She will not be murdered.
Rise and report.
You mean you wish to surrender to me?
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
A technicality that will shortly be remedied.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose.
Could this be a trap?
Your Princess is really a winning creature.
Now, where is that secret knot?
Your guess is as good as mine --
Who are you?
And it is guarded by sixty men.
Why? You can't even lift one.
Now?
Now?
Where's Fezzik?
Hello.
No --
-- yes --
-- all that I have and more please --
What? What?
Look, I'm retired.
Sir. Sir.
This is noble, sir.
He's dead. He can't talk.
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive.
True love.
Humiliations galore!
Thank you for everything.
Slow going?
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
I could do that.
We'll wait until you're ready.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
How old were you?
You seem a decent fellow.
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
You are wonderful!
Because I know something you don't know.
You're amazing!
There's something I ought to tell you.
Who are you?!
Kill me quickly.
Making sure nobody's following us.
Stop doing that.
Go in, get after her!
Look!
He's climbing the rope.
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
I want to duel him left-handed.
Let me explain-
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
I accept.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
You're just stalling now.
What's so funny?
You guessed wrong.
-- get back, witch --
"True love.
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier.
Bye-bye, boys.
You feeling any better?
Wait a minute.
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
"By the light, by the light,
Enough.
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
All right.
Yes sir.
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Look at that.
What is that?  A handkerchief?
Here, don't panic.
This is hardly a time for levity.
Help!
Yes, what?
Assume away!
See?
Mr.
Oh, I fell on my keys.
Will you get a hold on yourself.
What can I do?
Okay.
Good.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Where would you like to eat?
What kind now, Leo?
Everybody's a big shot.
You think you're not in prison now?
You bet your boots, Leo.
It won't run a week!
There it is... in red and white!
Mrs.
What are you doing?
How do you do.
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
To failure!
Maybe it's not true!
What are you doing with those books?
I never should have listened to you.
Here.
They are?
Max, I...
Don't help me.
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.
Wait.
Vaaaat???
Franz, trust me.
Not.
Five o'clock.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Plus to minus.
Here.
Vhy do you always call me kraut?
Do it!  Do it!
Do you need us?
Yes.
Bialystock and Blum.
Min Bialystock.
Come on.
You, Blum go Motel.
We make love?
Don't forget the checkee.
Finder's keepers.
Feeling better?
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Like clockwork.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
I solemnly swear...
Hindenburg...
Yes.
Okay.
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
We are falling back on all fronts.
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
You out to buy a motel?
No. At least I don't recall.
She's.
Let's all talk about Mary.
What's your interest?
Why?
I don't know.
Someone has seen her.
I'm in no mood for trouble!
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
Were there any calls?
Aren't you going to take the pills?
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
Call her sister!
Will you help us?
Yes.
She stole some money.
Please!
Yes.
Did he say anything about my sister?
I still feel...
Yes?
I'm Mary's sister.
Is something wrong?
What should I know?
What thing?
Yes.
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound.
Probably on his way back right now.
Stay here.
He didn't come back here?
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Our Deputy sleeps.
No, thank you.
I've only been here five.
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
Where'd you go to college?
I wonder so many things about her now.
You going to wait here for me?
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
Sorry.
What is it?
That's proof Mary was here!
You can't go up there.
It's regular. Okay?
You know what I'd like?
Dirty night.
Your home address.
I want sleep more than anything.
Stuffy in here.
You have something most girls never have.
I've caused you some trouble.
I'm sorry.
You're very... kind.
You eat like a bird.
It's a strange hobby.
An Institution?
I've suggested it myself.
In quite a hurry.
Wait a minute!
May I see your license?
Oh?
We have a problem.
Mary is Lila's sister?
Recluse. Kinder word.
Norman?
Barefaced.
Went out before service.
Just coming up to ring for you.
I'll take you to...
It isn't necessary.
I'll get your bags.
Looking for me?
My mother is not dead!
You look frightened.
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Yes.
He was out when I was there.
Was that all?
Now wait a minute, Sam.
You didn't find anything.
No mother.
Imagine--she was alive.
Did you wish to see someone?
You mean he doesn't work for you?
He's inherited a fortune.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
That's what I said.
No-
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
No, I don't want money.
No, no!
Thousands?
Oh, him.
I'm detective Jones.
How do you do.
Yes indeed.
What's down there?
You here again?
What's that?
Take me down there.
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
What are you going to do?
You can't double-cross me like that.
You are right.
[Something very important.
What is it?
What is it now?
What were you dreaming about?
Your father?
Did you hear?
The child!
You killed him!
Yes, why?
What are you laughing at?
I don't have any affairs.
But what about lunch?
There's no hurry. It's early.
I think so.
Disappoint me?
Why, certainly, sir.
But why?
We'll be coming to the opening.
But I think these things are beautiful.
Oh!
Let me go! Let me go!
What! What are you talking about?
Listen, copper, get a load of this.
Not a very good one, I guess.
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
I'm through clowning.
Well, ain't that a shame.
Which one is me? The horse?
Come in, Prussic Acid.
Well, why so mysterious!
I am right! I know I'm right!
Mit me, kid.
That's what I said.
Yes, sir.
Call the Homicide Squad!
Make it snappy, Colonel.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
I told you he was a sore.
Fine, thanks.
He might get some publicity out of it.
Well, I'll tell you a secret.
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
Yeah.
Listen, kid.
Now look here.
Please.
There she is!
Why?
What is it? What happened?
You are too gracious.
I came back for some of the books.
A fire!
I'm not asking you anything.
To lunch.
Have you got it? Is it completed?
Shall we unpack it?
I'd be glad to, Mr.
She is the soul of that statue.
What are you laughing at?
I'd know him anywhere.
Yep. Everything settled.
To isolation.
Don't waste it Pauly.
Two: what if I didn't miss?
What was her name?
Mia...?
I've been dreaming about you.
Could we go somewhere?
What?
Could you?
Why am I doing this?
We flopped the first time out.
Could be.
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
Of what?
What did it want?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
I've been dreaming about this.
Why?
Yes?
They're filthy, Mother.
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
Was that what they tried to do?
I didn't hear you.
No, I'm awake.
Hmmm, it's soft.
Just for a second.
Well, are you satisfied now?
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth!
You better quit that.
Rose, are you all right?
Well, Ill tell you this.
Here comes Daddy.
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
I got an awful toothache.
I gotta find out what they're saying.
Hi, Buddy.
Neither do I.
Yeah, I know.
Of course not!
You were up late last night, Brother.
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
I never saw anything like it.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
What do you think, Brother?
See that, son?
See, son?
Open that door, damn you!
I heard you talking.
The new girl is here.
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother.
Children, children!
Heh, what a hypocrite.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother.
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce.
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
It's really pitiful.
There goes Mother.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
I can't see.
Now I can't see.
Wow! Brrrother!
She's putting the titty back.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful?
No, Mother, he's lying...
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
What is Rose going to do?
What's happening?
What's goin' on?
Why is it taking so long?
Are they polar bears, too?
What's all this about Rose?
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Well, it's a disaster.
I am ahead of you.
It isn't the fourth dimension.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Turn up your hearing aid.
I'll drive you, darlin'.
What's the matter, hon?
Um-hmm.
Lay off of that stuff, son.
They'll put her in jail.
Well, she's back.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon.
Oh, shut up, Rose.
Now you listen to me, Rose --
I can't stand that polecat.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.
She's like a different person.
She hasn't actually done anything...
She does look a little peaky.
Her plan is obvious, plain as day.
This is a total catastrastroke.
Ah, ha!
Honey!
I'd say about three months.
This conversation is making me a little sick.
Reluctantly, I do.
I thought I knew you.
How is she?
It's twenty after one.
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Yes, sir.
Ahh-hem!
All right, all right.
Goddamn you, girl!
Rose, what are you doing up?
Nothin'.
You're so sweet.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Is this ill right?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Good morning, Rose.
I got an awful bad cold.
I didn't mean to bite him.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer!
God forbid.
Well, I have got news!
What baby?
Yes, I am.
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose.
Ha ha, course you make a lot more.
Took your time gettin' here.
Um-m, well...
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah.
You might see her.
Yes, dear, what is it?
What's the matter with him?
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
Oh, good evening, Doctor.
I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant.
Yes, go on.
What are you talking about?
I will not cry like a woman.
Rose, this is Waski.
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Oh, no, ma'am.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.
Yes, Ma'am.
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Never again, never again...
Rose, you're very sick.
You see, Rose?
Rose, you don't have to.
You'll never guess what happened!
I... I can explain...
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
Indivisible and inseparable.
How much?
You get nothing and like it.
And... ?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
This is private property.
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.
It's six o'clock.
Kittle...
What do you want?
Oh, you fuckers!
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Know what he's doing, Benny?
It's bone dry out there.
How's your precious little school-marm today?
She's right.
You shouldn't litter.
Just a little, you know.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
Sons of bitches!
I can work this.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
This is too fast.
Jiminy Christmas.
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
All I got is being a cop.
We shoulda been there to back you up.
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
"A.D."
Where you gonna be?
No offices are gonna be open today.
That's sick.
What's the plan?
When you planning to cut back on that?
I don't know what the problem is.
Who's been giving you history lessons?
They... they shot me.
Where we going?
How you doing back there?
Gimmie a butt.
Happy Independence Day.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
What's mine say?
Hey...
That's him alright.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
What the... ?!  What was that for?
Where we going?
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
Let's go!
I can't believe we're stealing.
Who said it wa's me, hub?
You live like a pig.
Don't talk like that.
What about Jack Daniels?
You could start over again with cash like that.
He tried to kill us.
Hey now, look!
Our resignations.
It's noon straight up.
He went to pick up lunch.
And, what... what am I forgetting?
What can we do for you, officers?
Couldn't have said it better myself.
You fuckers... damn you!
Pardon me.
Pure horse.
Arriving tonight
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?
Yeah... great.
I just think you should show some respect.
Alright?
We got him.
Hold your horses, sweetpea.
If they crash, maybe he'll run.
I'm gonna get beside him.
I'm gonna get beside.
You... SUCK!
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
What... ?  Not you too?
You need a doctor.
Any preferences?
Let's get this thing done.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
You get him?
Been waiting long?
Get his attention.
Hey-Ho... !
What the hell's his problem?
You suck at lying, Archie.
We're screwed.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.
Why the beach?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
The gang's all here!
You see that?
You always did have style.
This shit was Ming.
Admiral, we're in position.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
The shield is down!
I can't do it, Artoo.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
There's still good in him.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
What is thy bidding, my Master?

Nice work.

You cannot hide forever, Luke.

What's this, Roger?
Please, Raoul.
This is fifty bucks.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
He's a riot.
So you decided to help him after all?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
So what's the scam, Eddie?
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
Eddie, you still got it.
What was <u>that</u>?
What's that comin' from the bar?
I was hopin' you'd be there.
He's not my client.
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
Marvin Acme had no will.
They must've taken it off me.
Take it easy, Bongo.
I don't think it's gonna matter.
Well, why not?
No matter.
Come on, Doom.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
You?
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
Hello, Mr.
So altruistic.
You shot Roger.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
How did you get onto Doom?
So where is it?
Hold on a second.
Now what?
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
What's with the dip?
What the hell is that?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.

Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
Valiant!  You surprised me.
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
My advice?
Aah!

Yeah.
The habeus corpus is thickening.

Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'.
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
You damn Toon!
I'll get it.

If she is well then nothing can be ill.
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Romeo! Romeo!
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Keep away the cats!
Every man betake him to his legs.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now?
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Good marrow, father!
Banishment?
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Juliet!

I thought thy disposition better tempered!

Young hearts run free.

Follow me close.
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission!
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
Nurse.

Why did you do that?
It's under your seat.
We kept it...

So what's the deal?
And you believed me?
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
This.

Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
Do I need to repeat myself?
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
Hazard pay...

Now, what did we steal?
Well, if it isn't Mr.
Are you alright?
Not me.
Who are you?  IRA?
It's quite satifactory.
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Where's the case?
That fucking figures...
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
Do you have it?
Here's yours.
Where's my information?
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
And more importantly --
We'll die if we stay here!
What am I doing here?
Whoever hired us.
Is it done?
Gregor, is that you?
How so?
What are you doing?
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
He's tough, your American friend.
American.
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
Some, thanks.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
So this is what, a test?
So what is it you want to know?
You shoot alright.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
It's a cocktail.
What're you talking about, man?
They call me Swede.
You should watch what you eat.
I ride with fat-boy...
Where is this broad?
Sorry I'm late...
Perhaps the police?
Cigarette?
He trusts you to lock up?
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
Where to?
Pretty much what you'd expect.
He says this is their block.
What'd you say to him?
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
You were once some kind of special forces.
Lovely, isn't it?
What's going on?
I needed to know.
How did you know?
What's going on?
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
I borrowed that, too...
It was at that.
He's going back.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
Alright, it's done.
You know him?
The Irish representative?
What's this?
You sure your friend got the right place?
They don't have the package.
What the fuck happened?
Give me a cigarette.
I'm not here very much.
Do we need anything else?
Not here.  They might see it.
Time to quit.
You have to stop doing that!
Let's get him out of here...
You son-of-a-bitch...
"Your field dressing saved his life.
I told you, I quit.
What's the story?
Gaelic.
Why's that?
Why didn't you kill her?
You slept with her!
You slept with her!
My man, how you doing?
Do you have the tape?
Can you get it?
Sort of!
What the hell happened here?
Damn.
Whatsamatter with you?
I should kill you right here!
Ready to roll, partner?
Don't spend it all in one place.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
Thanks for the loan, man.
What the hell...
Ten thousand right here.
What are we going to do?
Call it in I guess.  Why?
No.  We can't.
It won't work.
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.
All right hold on!
I do.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
I've got one condition.
We're going to be patient.
Shhh!
I don't know!
I don't know...
Look.
We're dead.
Shit!
You're thinking about killing him.
That's not what I mean.
...Or get rid of the money.
He's going to be trouble.
We had a deal!
You said that last time!
You're out of your mind.
You think he's bluffing?
Look, Earl.
You're crazy.
How long is it going to take?!
What are you thinking?
Here it is.
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
Maybe we should say somethin'.
We're not?  How do you figure that?
Oh Jesus...
We got to get out of here.
Dwayne's dead.
What are you talking about?
It's too late...
You're the one who's nuts!
Just one more.
That'll bring me down, too.
Listen Earl.
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl.
Well, I don't know...
Ok.
Come on, Booth.
Whoa, Earl!
How are ya?
Thank you.
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Yeah?  So?
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
Hi.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Sally?
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
What happened to your cheek?
Like hell it's over.
Let's not get into this again.
You're worth every last penny.
So do I.
A satellite dish?
How are we going to do all this?
Why does that bother you?
Sally, do you love me?
Yeah, I've seen him.
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
Test the product?
Business is business.
I have a better plan.
And what's that?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
Why?
What makes you say that?
I don't know.
What do you think about all this?
I guess we can get started.
Well nothing audible to us.
Uh, no...
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Oh that was Agent Wallace.
Don't you have to be here?
We don't know.
Sheriff Hogan --
OK.
Mr.
Some of it.
Yeah.
Hello.
Anything I can help you with?
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
Yeah, she is.
Just goes to show you.
Damn its hot in here...
Very clumsy, very clumsy.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
She's not his type.
Jesse?
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.
Nice of you to join us.
Something wrong, Jesse?
What's this?
Hey where's the hot pad?
It was going to be a surprise!
What are you saying?
Nothing.
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Whatever...
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
You'd do this to me?!
Dwayne please calm down!
Hey we're all friends, right?
I'll settle for a third of that.
We're out of here.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
I'm not asking.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
Don't hurt me.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect.
Hi ma.
I didn't know you were coming.
How's work?
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
This whole place?
Don't you want it?
Thank you honey.
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.
That fire was set.
Yeah.
This isn't right...
Is it true, Carter?
What the hell is that?
Winner six!
Winner!  Four, winner!
Invitation, please.
Wait.
What?
I knew it.
How you doing, baby?
You see, no bomb.
Yeah, that's right.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
I'm busy at the moment.
Let's go.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
Do you have it in you, Lee?
Oh, you American?
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
Any girl?
Wait a second.
Stevie, how's it going my man?
Of course not.
That's what I'm talking about.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.
Carter, get off that stage!
What'd I say?
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
You lied to me.
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
Hello.
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Where are you going?
Carter?
No, no, that would be crazy --
So are you getting on the plane or not?
It sounds impossible --
I should go back.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
Slow down, baby.
Is it hot in here?
She's getting undressed.
What's she doing?
I don't understand?
Pick it up!
Wait!  There's people down there!
I wouldn't do that!!!
Let me see it again?
Secret Service Agent Carter.
Are you okay?
Look, man I'm sorry.
I'm not used to having a partner.
Very nice.
Hello, Benjamin.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Vegas...
Red Dragon.
Let's go.
Couple?
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
Isabella?
Lee!
Ricky Tan is alive.
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
Lee, wait a second.
We made it, man.
I saw that.
That your gate down there?
Your father's badge?
What is this?
They owe us, man.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.
I could use a little vacation.
Quite a night, Inspector.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Is this a payoff?
Put your arms around me.
What's going on?
You move well.
Behind me is the soft count room.
Are you okay?
I didn't know which side you were on.
Master Ching taught me.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Do you still have the bills?
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Lee, I've missed you, brother.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
You're just like your father, Lee.
I need your help, Master.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
Who the hell is that?
You don't move, you understand?
You know what a phone booth is?!
Lee!  It's him!
What is your name?
Good job.
Feds asked for me?
And that, of course, would be me.
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
He stole my wheel!
You talk very fast.
Beach Boy.
Help me Rhonda.
You have one of these?
You speak English!
-- what the hell is that?
Where were we?
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
What about them?
You make the plate?
You talk too fast.
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
You see what I'm sayin'?
Let's get us a photo and description.
You like it?
You want more?
Now, that's American music.
That's not how it goes.
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.
Are you OK?
Want some?
What?!
Which one?
This is my territory now.
Like that.
No, please, I don't --
No, wait.
Oh no, I dropped it.
I'm sorry, Lee.
What are you doing here?
Oh no.
Oh my god. Griffin.
What a surprise!
Yeah.
Not anymore.
You're killin' me here.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.
Hey, baby, it's cool.
How'd what go?
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Jesus...what do you want?
Oh my god...what happened to you?
Wait a minute.
You don't like it?
You OK?
How about a lift home?
Any demands yet?
I'm talking about the girl.
What kind of assignment is that?
What do you mean you lost him?
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Yo, Johnson...
Hmmmm?
Oh yeah.
Okay, let me start from the top.
You know something?
You got a boy friend in here yet?
You sonuvabitch.
Where do we find him?
Hello.
My daughter.
Yes.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
I would like one of my people to help.
I am not an American, Mr.
Come on.
I am so sorry about your men.
I will not have friends in America.
What is he up to now?
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
At the wedding?
Right.
Yes.
Ahh.
See you at the wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
You look awful.
Really?
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.
Only respectful things.
God.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
And in a "V".
We do it to our dog.
I'll get the dress.
Bob's in a hurry.
I love his eyes.
Rub your ears.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
-- It's for you, Ike.
Lesson number two.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
Lawyers.
Fisher, let him talk.
Is that what I did to you?
Maggie!
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.
Look, he's running after her.
In vino veritas.
Vindication.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
Look -- I'll be in there later today.
No.
Of course we are.  Of course.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
Same as you said.
I don't know.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
I'm not sure.
Well, I'm off.
It's okay.
Hello.
What?
I am just such a reporter.
And you are?
I think you'd look good in red.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Your two cinnamon rolls.
They made me put my hat back on.
Like her mother.
I hope you have a different angle.
Getting nervous?
Weird dreams?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
That's fair.
Everest.  Is that right?
How romantic.
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.
Give me that!
Look, look, man.
You've been here for three minutes.
You misinterpret everything.
You're welcome.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.
Too much.
It's a birthday present for my cousin.
I think so.
Always a mood killer.
I'm a work in progress.
I don't know.
You look... uh... You look fine.
I'll have the same.
Tell me.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.
Watch your leg, Dad.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Kind of isolated.
No.
Where did you disappear to?
I don't know, give me a minute.
It's fun!  It's high.
No.
I'm sorry, Bob.
About a minute...?
Okay.
I love you.  I love you.
To who?  Are you asking me?
Yes, you!
I've been making friends with your cat.
Livid is good.
Does it matter?
Used?
You were not.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
You're a goddess!
Reporter?
Okay, he's on base.
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Good morning to you, too.
I know.
I'm going to kill myself.
You're right.
Lighten up, wahine.
He's going to be the pastor?
Grandma!
He's not coming.
Let's go.
You okay?  I'm closing.
What are you talking about?
I'm really rooting for this one.
What?
You tell Maggie.
There's no why, Annie.
You take the microwave?
Tell me he's living in squalor.
Don't touch them.
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
Is that all right with you?
They loved you.
Happy New Year, darling.
We will?
Who is it?
Miss Scarlett.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
You go.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
Walter.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
You okay?
Oh!
You should write something about this.
It's not true, but it feels true.
What was that about up there?
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
You're a basket case.
And this woman is a writer!
You want to hear about destiny?
Men never get this movie.
Hello.
Did you talk to him?
You told a lie and got on a plane.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
It's a sign --
You don't know who she was, Annie --
This is a photo of hair.
Becky?
So he can't write.
You're going to miss the train.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
Please --
This is a complete disaster.
Oh God, it's major.
Are you Annie?
I'm Jonah.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
It's probably just the flowers --
It's silly, really.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Sure you do.
Hello.
Hi.
It's you.
Which means --
Great.
Hello.
I'm not mad at you.
All righ...
Why not?
What are you going to do, Sam?
What was it that made you know?
No last names, Jonah.
You don't like the one he was now?
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
No.
Is he home right now?
Hey, my plate is full.
When's the latest time you were out there?
Dad, could you close the door?
Write her.
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
Dad --
I can hear you walking around sometimes.
Dad?  About last night?
Not.
Dad, I don't know about this one --
Does red pepper go under R or P?
Fine.  Fine.
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
How did they get our phone number?
She looks like my third grade teacher.
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
It was sinking.
This one's for both of us.
Great.
Listen to this --
Dad!
Here is Seattle.
Why is she bringing that bag?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
Don't ever do that again.
What are you doing up?
Did you call that radio station again?
Jonah, this isn't fair.
God, she's beautiful.
Have you seen my wallet?
I have to have a life.
Fine.
Shut up?
What if I couldn't get to you?
I can't believe you flew first class.
Hi, Sam.
Do you like baseball?
Sure.
Hi.
We live two piers over, don't we?
Five minutes in the microwave.
God, it's wonderful to see you.
You saw her in the airport and then here?
How's Jonah taking it?
It's a little derivative.
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Hi.
You look good.
I thought you were never going to call me.
We can't finish the job.
Is he there?
He's ten.
I told you it would happen.
I mean it.
Mornin'.
Not so sure about that.
Well?
Got any more ideas?
Take a drink. Calm down!
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass?
Jenkins ain't no boss.
How goes it?
Three hours!
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero.
Now wait a minute.
Foreman wants to get the ore out.
I checked the drift just before he blasted.
Are you sick, Mama?
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Why are they singing, Mama?
To the mine?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it?
He can't drink this milk.
It's all set.
We're only one payment behind.
Where you going?
This water's cold again.
Forget it.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
First we got to get equality on the job.
Stop it!
I did not mean to weep again.
Was it expensive, the beer?
What's the matter?
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
A fighter, huh?
What were they saying?
Not just Juanito.
Let them take it!
You all right?
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
You might get hurt.
I'm telling you.
How do you feel?
Did you have to sign a pledge?
I waited up till midnight.
Tell me.
Where are you going?
Ramn were not getting weaker.
This is what we've been waiting for.
Why didn't you support her?
Don't horse me.
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
Go on. Spill it.
That's all right -- it's no secret.
What are you doing here?
Lus! Come down here!
Where's your mama?
Boy!
Papa, can't I leave now?
Ramn ... listen for the love of God ...
And another thing.
No, I don't mind.
Bobby?
What?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.
What?
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
All I saw was the headlights.
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
What is it?
Ride 'em cowboy)
I wanna do a small buy first.
Yeah.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
Oh God.
How?
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Could be worse.
What?
Why don't you call the cops?
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
Oh. Hi.
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
Is that how you play?
: What are you up to?
Who is it?
We been through that.
It's not that easy.
From day one.
Why not?
What's wrong, Danny?
No.
Really, I don't want to.
What is it?
Will you do that?
You're good, princess.
Colette, go.
How you holding up?
Oh shit
Who is it?
Closure?
How the hell did we get this detail?
What time is it?
Where to?
Nice day
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
I'm hurting.
That's a good one.
So, why'd you want to see me?
What?
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...
Fuuuuuck
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
You wanna score some go-fast?
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
You want a hit?
Can I ask you something?
Danny?
What's this?
Okay
Why?
What the hell is that?
What?
But...I've seen you.
No one ever noticed?
But... why? Why would you pretend?
I don't know.
Nah.
By not disgracing her memory!
You don't understand.
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
Not bad.
Can we talk price?
You're serious?
So that's 40 lbs.
You want to do this some other time?
Come on, guys ...
Pooh-Bear.
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
Don't address me.
Shoot him.
Now get talkin'
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
What the hell is this?
Cool it. We got business.
I've got a hot one.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
You got a name?
Yeah.
Danny, I'm touched.
You think I'm a Judas?
Thanks for not judging me.
You don't find that repugnant?
I was getting to it.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
What the hell are you doing here?
You think this is funny motherfucker?
I met the guy at a party.
What're your taking down?
You've got no choice.
Bullshit. He's a liar.
That's because he doesn't have one.
What? Is it bad?
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.
Murder.  Beautiful.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
Danny?
Whatever you say, man.
Please ... don't do this ...
This the guy?
That's him.
He knows somebody ratted him.
Fuck you, Garcetti.
We know what's going on.
Jimmy?
What's on the other end of this thing?
What's that smell?
Who'd have thought it?
Excuse me?
You're lucky, Flynne.
Come on!
When is the deal going down?
Nervous?
A virtuoso rendition.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
You think that's a good idea?
My sentiments exactly.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
We're in business.
Where's Bubba?
Danny, listen up.
What is that? Rum and coke?
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Find a chaplain.
Report.
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
Good luck, John.
So, where are you from?
I'm Jackson.
That must be four thousand yards.
Did you see what he did, back there?
Jackson?
Last I knew.
So, that's Ryan.
Yes, sir.
Y'all come back.
What do you think?
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
He ain't Wade.
No kiddin'?
Me?
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
Where?
We left them eighty-eights.
Watching.
Not yet.
How about that jeep?
A paratrooper named Ryan.
I know about bracketing.
Glad of it.
Upham?
I wasn't made for this.
It looks like a Renoir.
Over three-hundred.
What is it?
Good luck, Captain.
I wonder where they're going.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
What about our grenades?
What'd you say, Captain?
Captain, what about our deal?
GO!
Worked, didn't it?
Caen?
You get a translator, Captain?
Uh, Captain...
Got it, sir.
You ever going to open those letters?
You think they'll be alright?
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
A couple of weeks.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
How about...?
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck.
You alright?
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
What do you think?
Uh, oh.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?
I don't think so, Captain.
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.
Captain, can I ask you a question?
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Reiben, what's the matter with you?
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Up.  We're moving out.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.
Maybe Caen.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
What deal?
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Goddamn it!
Private.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
I'd like to go, sir.
Don't do that again.
You set?  Sarge nods.
Is jumped on by one.
Doesn't move.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Yes, Private.
So what?
Shit, sir.
Who cares?
I usually like surprises.
Damn fool.  Sir.
So, where are you from?
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
Demolition, right?
How do you do it?
You think he really believed it?
How fast?
Jesus.
Hi.
Thanks, I like yours too.
Keep it.
Lloyd?
It's no problem.
Why do you eat that stuff?
You're tough, J-man.
I'll be in my office.
No, no, don't go in there.
Hello Constance.
That's unlikely.
Then what's love?
Look at those eyes.
You are such a great person Lloyd.
Did you sleep with her?
Alright.
What does it say?
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
No, you're not a guy.
I don't feel anything.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
Lloyd is doomed.
I told him to be himself.
Lloyd, it's us.
Wait a minute.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.
Why?
I can't give you that.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
That was a mistake.
Visit her at the home.
Well, it's almost over.
Ha!
What are you doing?
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
They really applauded you today honey.
What?
Don't do this to me.
Morning honey.
Goodnight.
Well, let me start it.
Oh yeah.
Morning.
Lloyd?
Did he ever get rough with you?
Do you love him?
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
Dad, are you okay in there?
What happened to you?
Hello.
Mom, please?
Thank-you.  The real world.
Actually, I think that I...
Well...
Alright.
Whoa.
What are these?
Keymaster?
So we can finally talk?
He does this every year?
Thank-you.
Have a good sleep.
It's just you and your dad, right?
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
Yeah.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
Nice one.
Oh.
After work?
Stop by later.
You have to meet Bess.
Yes.
It's okay, everybody does that.
Okay, this is important...
Little more gas.
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
Are you comfortable?
Check your mail tomorrow.
I think that we should spend some time apart.
Okay, what did we just decide?
What do you want?
I'm fine.
Okay.
How's it going?
It's your castle, man.
You're freaking out here man.
Yeah.
YEAH!
PAIN!
Jim Court?
Okay, I'll give here the message.
Hi.
Thanks Lloyd.
Yeah Lloyd.
Hi, Lloyd.
She wouldn't get out of the car.
Joe.
My car.
Diane Court.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd.
Oh boy.
Ooop, excuse me.
It's gotta stay purple.
Oh, I was just going to...
Certainly.
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
I love you man
Give me my firebird keys!
Later for you, Luke.
Oskar - my friend Lena.
He's essential.
Well, let's find him.
What's your name?
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
You know what, you'd like her.
It's not a charade, all this?
Luck.
What?
Should I stay?
Should I stay?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
All right, okay, let's talk.
We started without you.
He looks great, though, doesn't he?
Scherner told me something else about you.
Do you have any idea what's involved?
It's true.
You held back Stern.
You took my workers.
You want these people.
What are you, Moses?
Where are the guards?
What's that?
Ghetto Police.
Hey, Poldek, how's it going?
What do I got for you?
The SS beat me up.
Like this?
How many?
How you feeling, all right?
What's wrong with it?
Good.  How's it going?
What are you doing?
Oskar, good of you to come.
Thank you.
That'd be fine.
The place produces nothing.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.
I was just the accountant.
Jews, yeah.  Investors.
Pots and pans.
What?
Don't ever do that to me again.
I got to go, I'll see you.
I'll talk to him.
Four hundred, four fifty -
Eight hundred, give or take.
That's very generous of you.
We need to talk.
They arrived.
Well, that's to be expected.
I'll talk to you later.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
We know that, son.
I can do it, Captain.
How's the name search going?
Can't we hold him?
We're going to bring her in.
Have you checked the...
We don't know if it's random.
Jesus Christ.
He's broken his pattern.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
No, they broke up again.
That shit.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Shit.
Outside.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hello? Ted?
WHAAAATT?
Jesus, you scared me.
Tina, it's Dawnie.
Cotton.
Its perfect, Sidney.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
You know the story, Gale.
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me.
Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.
What are you going to do?
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
I could use some therapy.
I think he's doing Dolly.
How are you?
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Where have you been'?
About what?
Lemme take you home.
This is exactly what I don't want.
I had the four o'clock shift.
Go on, untie him.
Why?
Two.
Where's Sid?
She's got guards with her.
He seemed harmless.
Need some help, honey.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS?
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
Of course not.
A twist ending if you will.
Oh yeah.
We had to have financing.
Hello, Dwight.
You have every right to be upset.
I'm sorry.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
Not good. How you doin?
You broke my heart.
And it's sexier in the dark.
They're roomates.
Ssshh! What was that?
This is all too familiar.
Maybe they never got here.
Jesus Christ!
Let's go.
Dewey?
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
The police are waiting outside.
Hey, I got stuff to do.
Who is this?
Who are you?
What do you want?
Where are you?
Oh--a God complex
What do you want from me?
What do you mean?
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
Sid, I'll come with you.
What?
Someones trying to kill me.
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
I have rehearsal.
Shut up.
He tried to kill her first.
I got a surprise for you.
"If I should stay.
You're going to get it.
Knock yourself out.
Time to change numbers again?
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
That was good.
Who is that guy?
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
It's okay to break, girl.
Can I come with her?
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate.
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door.
The young girl runs by a window.
How many guys they have on you?
I've been waiting for you, baby.
Randy Meeks.
And white.
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
I gotta hit the library.
Perfect.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
..this week's TKE kegger...
It's all about sisterhood.
Hello?
What do you care?
Do you want to die?
I hate scary movies.
Take it off.
Now why does she have to be naked?
You ass.
Come on, baby.
Sid?
I'll be right back.
What was that?
What do you want?
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
There's always someone out there stalking actors.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt.
Jesus.  Hello?
Well what number are you trying to reach?
What do you mean?
It's CICI!
You're not playing by the rules Ben.
Yeah.
Where are you?
Can I help you?
I don't watch TV and I hate books.
Listen, I'm busy.
What are these movies?
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers.
Who?
Four? There are five.
OK, look.
Jesus Gale what happened?
Are you sure?
What do you know about trilogies?
Mr. Rielly?
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Is that a threat, Detective?
Detective Kincaid?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened?
What are you doing here?
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
I can see nothing's changed.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Yeah?
Where's Gale?
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Watch out Sid.
They found another note?
Jennifer needs me.
Stop following me.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Thank you.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?
Sidney, what happened?
Paternity test results.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
What's your point?
What the hell are you guys getting at?
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
Your life?
Would you excuse me for a moment?
You!
AND I DIE NAKED?
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Who's phone?
God damn it you two!
Geez.
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Basements creep me out.
Nobody said she was an actor.
Oh, Come on!
I think Milton's the killer.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
And now?
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
I think we should go inside.
Oh my God!
What'd he say?
We did some researching in the archives.
Gale he's got Dewey!
Roman Bridger, director.
Listen, I have no time for this.
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
What are you talking about?
Roman and everybody else went home for the night.
Do you think it's over Sidney?
Don't do it!
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney.
You're dead!
Where?
Yeah?
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Hello?
What? She asked.
I didn't kill anybody.
Owwww...
How'd you do?
You ready to party hard tonight?
Dude. What are you doing here?
Where ya going?
You have to play, Sid.
Tell that to Cotton Weary.
Nope.
Think about it.
This is the best part, Sid.
Ready?
What if your father snapped?
That's it, Billy.
It's on the table.
I thought she was dead.
She can't get both of us.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
Thank you, Hank.
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
Billy? What the...
My dad's in the other room.
Close call.
You know what my dad will do to you?
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
Oh Billy... Please... God...
Jesus, SHIT!
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
So...
I wanna let go. I do...
Sshh... it's okay.
You heard me.
Who did you call?
I thought you were...
NO! Don't believe him.
Why did you kill my mother?
I don't understand...
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
Hello?
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
I'm gonna rip you up bitch.
Yes.
Hello.
What?
Hello.
Popcorn.
I don't know.
Uh.
Why do you want to know my name?
What did you say?
I have to go now.
Yes?
Listen, asshole...
Is this some kind of a joke?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
What do you want?
Look, enough is enough.
I lied.
How do you know his name?
Where are you?
Please don't hurt him.
I wanna play a game.
What kind of game?
Please don't do this...
I don't know...
What's his name?
Michael... Michael Myers.
Now for the real question.
...please... no...
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
You tricked me...
...leave me alone... please...
What door am I at?
Hi!
And why is that? Has something happened?
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
I just turned 25.
Evening, ma'am.
Sheriff just radioed me.
So is Dewey your real name?
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
I'll call for backup.
What are you doing here?
Does mom know?
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
What did Mama tell you?
A party?
No, Dewey.
What is she doing here?
Did you reach my Dad?
Any word on my Dad?
Billy was released.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
You girls ready.
Have they found my father?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
I was first to respond.
She staying with you?
She's okay.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
That fish smelled strong.
Jesus...
Where is she?
Casey?
Where is she?
Casey! Casey!
What? What?
Jesus Christ!
No, not so fast.
What's the plan?
The control board's glitched.
It's okay, Tatum.
How's the book?
I'll look for it.
I'm not here to fight.
Off the record. No cameras.
Please. You owe me.
You owe my mother.
He was convicted in a court of law.
She was never attacked.
What if she did it?
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve?
You're evil.
Cut some slack.
Where do you get this shit?
I have no idea.
Are you alone in the house?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
So where are you?
Can you see me right now?
Good try, Randy.
Hello?
Poor Billy-boyfriend.
Are you okay?
Have a good trip.
Stu was with me last night.
Stop. Right there.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
For about two seconds.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
Jesus, this place is packed.
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
You're absolutely right.
I thought everything was checked out.
What's Leatherface doing here?
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts.
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Why are they doing this?
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
You're crazy -- both of you.
So Stu, what's your motive?
Do you believe this shit?
Oh God!
Or a man's mentality.
You sure I can stay over?
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
It's okay.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Do you really think Billy did it?
Take a message.
Come on, Sid.
Just relax.
This is a mistake.
Shit, what is he doing here?
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
This could be good.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth.
Hey, Sid.
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
Billy's right.
Who?
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
There's that sense of humor.
Hunt?
I thought you dumped her for me.
Is this not cool or what?
That's mature.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
I got it.
That's not necessary.  You're in.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
How is it working for a scumbag like this?
What do you think?
You've left unfinished business before.
Have you heard?
Already.
It's none of my business anymore.
Come on.
Well, there he sits.
How you feeling?
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
I guess.
She was.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
I don't believe it.
What do you mean?
What's so exciting?
What time is it?
Give me the gun.
You didn't know.
Where we headed?
I can't wait for you to see.
Tell me what it was that gave me away.
Just keep leading the way.
You've made a good life for yourself...
Here he comes.
Somerset...
I'm a little thrown.
You just met me.
Who said this was murder?
There's a bucket here.
It's a bucket of vomit.
You think it was poison?
You've seen my files, right?
Is that clear?
Same color and texture.
This doesn't make any sense.
It could be nothing.
This is his stuff.
I'm declining this case.
It's too soon for him.
It's a package deal.
It's my wife.
Well?
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
You go to movies at least?
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Gould's wife.
He's preaching.
No fingerprints?
No witnesses of any kind?
This is the one thing.
You're sure your men didn't move this?
Nothing.
What the fuck is that?
There must be something.
What?
Oh, yeah, sure.
He just may be nuts enough.
Does this make it with you?
Why would we?
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.
How did the fire fight end?
How was it?
It is Victor.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
This quote.
How much money do you have?
Well, that was money well spent.
So they ran our list.
This is a waste of time.
Modern Homicide Investigation.
You're sure you're reading that right?
What are you going to say?
Are you alright?
Wait... just wait.
The hell I can't!
Think about it...
You stupid son of a...
What are you talking about?
We could use about fifty more men here.
He's preaching.
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
Oh, you want to stay now?
You knew I'd say yes.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
You know he's fucking us.
No.
What is it?
Stay with him.
Throw your gun down now!
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
Tell me it's not true.
Put your gun down!!
I'm sorry about this, Mrs.
Anything... anything missing or different.
This painting...
It's nice to meet you.
It smells good.
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
Don't worry.
I was close once.
How long have you lived here?
I don't know, with this case.
I mean, you known this city.
Perfect example.
Why always like this?
Did their son see it happen?
How's California?
You askin' me to clear out now?
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
Let's get along...
You've said that enough!
Why'd they break off?
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
Another one, eh?
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
You all right, sergeant?
Haven't seen you since the surrender.
You ain't goin'...
He cometh forth like a...
What good does that do?
What do you know about it?
You got any more orders, Captain?
I didn't give any order to fire!
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
I say NO!
What in...?
Go on!
If there's anything I can do, sir...
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir.
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
Unnt-meah!
No Debbie!
Ay-eh...They was here...
Steady, Daniel Boone!
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Well, the reward still stands...
Mose...try to remember!
How'd you come by this?
Talk!
Sir -- we charged!
Not quite.
What you want me to call you?
Well, come on!
Nothing for you to see.
Easy on that!
You want us to fire a shot if...
You all right, Ethan?
Say!
What you goin' to do?
Say it. We're beat!
Good night...Laurie...
Hey! What's the idea...?
Futterman?
That's the way to train 'em.
You ask her!
I think maybe we oughta...
Ethan, quit it!
Well, you're a widower now...
No...She's not...
Lemme alone...
Stay out here.
You figger Scar means to kill us?
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Go on!
They'll be back...
What's that got to do with us?
Wait!
Was your niece about their age?
Why it's just a snip of calico...
She's not a little girl any more.
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
They never find that girl.
Don't go takin' that stuff...
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?
Might at least have left me my pants!
Futterman!
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
She'd be about thirteen now...
Why else?
Say it anyway.
I have to cut his windpipe...
Ellen, move aside...
Stop that!
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Hey... the fuse.
Do you know where fuse box is?
Look at this!
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
I have a funny feeling.
I miss Tommi so much.
Who was that?
Martin, it's not funny!
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
So, did you sleep good?
Hey, you're still here.
Where have you been all day?
But that's not the point!
Where have you been?
It's just a feeling.
Who's that?
What?
She was old.
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
Will you finally cut it out?
Martin, what-
Of course you'll give me the blame again.
Oh, Ellen.
I told you, there is no way out.
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
What?
How did you get me out of there?
For God's sake, what happened to me?
Ellen.
Oh, Ellen!
I really hate to bother him, but...
Frank Kosinski.
That's alright.
Hello.  Can I help you?
No, I've never seen him before.
Ellen Straub.
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
And that is?
Mrs. Straub!
It all went so fast.
Oh, Mrs.
Stop scaring people.
You didn't tell her!
I think it's starting again.
Hammer?
Well, look here!
Damn, this thing is heavy.
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
Twenty-three, to be exact.
Hey, my man!
WillWhere is Mercutio?
You did not like the speech?
NedI knowI know
You are a gentleman.
Ohwhat have I done?
Follow that boat!
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Do you know that house?
Oh, Thomas!
Thank you, my lady!
What do you want, Kit?
We have no Juliet!
We will all be put in the clink.
Are you writing?
I swear it.
How long has it been?
A woman of property?
Will it restore my gift?
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
I have not said all.
When?
I have a wonderful new play!
What's the title?
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?
This time we take your boots off!
Where is the play?
Is it going well?
I want no more trouble, Mr.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
It is over.
No Juliet?!
Do you know it?
Will!
Who is she this time?!
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Where are you going?
Now where? Will?
I feel a scene coming on.
Romeo and Rosaline.
Will! Have you finished?
My tailor.
Nobody. The author.
Cut round him for now.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
By God, I wish I knew.
We are lost.
Another little problem.
Kit
I insist--and a beaker for Mr.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
"Good morrow, cousin."
"But new struck nine."
"Out."
Two hours at prayer!
Not ready? Where is she?
Be good to her, my lord!
God bless you!
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best?
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
He sees himself in me!
Your mother, and your father
Your Majesty.
I have seen you.
And--?
Your Majesty
Your Majesty!
"I know not."
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
Will!
Mr. Pope!
Master Shakespeare
I would not for the world!
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
Like you, I found him not at home!
What does Burbage care of that?
Who are you, master?
Better fortune, boy.
I like it when they cut heads off.
My lady!
Anon, good nurse.
Oh my lady, my love!
Can you love a fool?
Wait!
I do not know how to undress a man.
I would not have thought it.
You would not leave me?
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Oh, do not go
Oh, Will!
"Good night, good night.
I found something in my sleep.
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
Will! What--?
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
Nono.
Will you read it for me?
"thou need'st not to be gone."
A hired player no longer.
But all ends well.
My lady Viola.
My lady VIOLA.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
Good morning, my lord!
You look sad, my lady!
He is dead?
Your name?
Take off your hat.
Yes, sir.
She tells me to keep away.
And her lips?
Oh!
"Poet?"
How do I offend, my lord?
Here we come at last, my lord!
Is there a man?
You upstart inky pup!
What's his name?
All right, just a few questions.
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
What do you think?
He made it clear.
Only on expenses.
No, she's not in.
No.
You mean immoral.
He's still here.
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
Family?
I don't know.
Finished.
Don't you worry about that.
That was good.
Listen, it's important.
What's the problem?
Good luck.
How much did you pay?
What is this?
Doesn't it worry you?
What's all this for, more security?
What? Yes, that's fine.
I want to secure it.
You looking for me?
Who?
It wasn't deep enough.
But they know.
Sex lines?
What?
Out in the woods.
Is this being recorded?
Well, is it?
That's it, then.
What?
Right.
That's right.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
What?
Cameron.
Did you know --
I thought you stopped going.
God, you two are sensitive.
Has he tried down the back of the fridge?
Who was it?
So we'll meet him, then?
Aroused and inflamed.
I'm not usually drunk.
Have you seen Hugo?
David hasn't seen him either.
Hugo.
I wonder how he did it?
Alex.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Who's going to do it?
Whoever draws the short straw does it all.
Be careful.
Sshh.
Love and happiness for ever.
David, I promise we will.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
Hello. Hello.
Will you calm down.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
I don't see the point in that.
Leave him alone.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Later. But first -- him.
Expecting anyone?
Aren't you going to answer it?
No, definitely not.
You'll wait in the hall?
Are you all right?
I don't know.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
It's about me and David.
Stop him, Alex.
Interesting.
So, uh...
It's OK. There's no problem.
Can you afford this place?
Good evening.
Two?
I see.
Is this where no one stays?
No, I've never seen them.
Why do you want a room here?
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question.
Just get on with it, Alex.
Is this what they always look like?
I've never seen a dead body before.
Are you all right?
Do you know many of these people?
Two hundred.
Expecting anyone?
I thought you'd gone to work.
I'm sorry.
We already know. All about it.
So let's go.
Yes.
Eh, I don't know.
What do we do here, David?
Hello.
What guy that died?
You must be Hugo.
It's nice.
What do you do?
Do you think you could answer that?
It was some guy called Brian.
Shall I answer it?
Working nights?
Take all the time you like, doctor.
No. I haven't seen them.
Both, sir.
Offering it for debate.
You can tell by the intonation.
Your watch.
You're in a good mood today, George.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
Don't you think there's too much gold?
I thought you were in a good mood.
Do you think George is a fairy?
That's George.
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
Lester.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
We cannot go into this later.
-- is that right?
-- is that what this is all about?
What're you looking for?
Thanks a lot.
She's got a...
You're late, George.
George --
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
I can see that.
I don't know.
Is she all right?
-- Anyway.
Hi.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
But aren't you...
Why didn't you come alone?
Oh, no.
You going to answer it?
Want me to?
You're rude.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
Shit.
You here to see my mother?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
Well, are you?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
Yeah, it is.
I am not!
Right now?
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
Jesus, look at this.
What sort of references do you have?
George!
You're late, George.
What!
So how's Norman?
Jesus...
How long you had this?
-- Well no. It never came up.
Shut up, it's all right.
Where do you want to do this?
Well, what do you think?
Jill's coming with us.
... I don't get it done often.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
No.
Why not?
It was after you, baby. After you.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud.
George...
George... how about Felicia?
Baby...
George...
No! Don't! Please!
It'll ruin everything.
Sit down.
Look, either come in or stay out!
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern.
We're upstairs, George.
Don't do it.
He just completely ignores me.
-- Just get me out of here, baby.
-- don't you want to --
-- you are.
-- gee...
That sounds like me.
Where do you want to go?
What are you looking at?
-- yeah.
-- where'd you go?
-- very nice, very nice.
What's wrong?
-- we're kidding ourselves.
-- Jesus --
-- good afternoon --
I've got to leave?
Where are you going?
-- It's Malone's.
You're going to kill me.
Jackie... Jackie?
God, there's Lester...
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
Hey, what's happening?
Yeah!
-- White ladies?
That boy always does great.
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk?
Jackie Shawn.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
Hi, George.
Call me!
There were some shots.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
I don't know.
Nobody's gonna get you.
George --
How are you, baby?
Honey?
Will we live together?
Maybe you don't even like children.
George.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Yeah, baby...
Great.
Yeah.
George.
What do you want?
When?
Jill says nothing.
What business meeting?
I know, honey.
What does he direct besides traffic?
Now, Jackie --
I've got to get her out of here.
I don't want to fight, George.
How come you took your own car?
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Didn't you, baby?
That was him.
Yes.
-- and take this with you.
So who else was there besides Jackie?
Obviously.
Baby, please don't... I love you.
... well I'm glad you told me.
What? What? What? What? What?
I wish you'd go now.
What're you here for?
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
It's an unusual trade.
When?
Tonight?
Sorry, honey, I...
... she's very upset...
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
Well anyway...
Well -- I could try.
This really ought to be layered...
You live like a pig.
I wanna hear about it.
I wanna hear about it, George.
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
Want a drink?
You really think so?
What took you so long?
You're home.
Well, commercials.
Well maybe I can get you something.
The man from Sloan's is coming.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.
You and your touchy investors.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school.
Shut the door, shut the door!
I'd like a drink.
They get hair all over the place.
Here.
George, glad you could make it, son.
Who are they?
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
Jackie Shawn.
-- you phony asshole --
Hi, Leonard.
Poster-Kleiser.
I think you're crazy.
I am? I mean why?
Well, he is.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie.
Five times a day?
Egypt?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Oh. thank you.
Why don't you ask for another one?
I'm terribly sorry.
-- oh, sure.
George? Was he alone?
That bastard.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
-- why?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
You're kidding.
What's wrong?
-- what's the problem, honey?
-- I'll get in the back --
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
-- yes, Jill.
You seem disappointed.
No!
We'll let you know tomorrow.
No of course not.
Everything okay, son?
Call me Les.
Dad?
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
How's it going, Doc?
Are you having a good time?
No.  I'm just a little tired.
Yes I do.
Dad?
I love you, Danny.
You don't?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Chocolate.
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Yes.
I don't know.
Maybe he showed me something.
No, I'm scared of nothing here.
No I ain't.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
Jack...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay Danny, you win.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
It's so pretty.
Mom?
Well all right.
Danny?
Red Rum.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Mommy...
Mommy!
Oh,
Shall we go into the living room?
Please...
But eh what was the matter with him?
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Tony.
What sort of injury did he have?
How did he manage to do that?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.
That doesn't matter, sir.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.
Grady?
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Yes, sir.
No.
How?
She eh... interferes.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
No need to rub it in, Mr.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Mrs.
Beg pardon?
No, we don't mind.
Bill, how do you do?
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
What'll it be?
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.
Hi Lloyd.
It's good to see you.
No charge?
Hi, babe.
Boy, we must be really high up.
Sure is.
Perfect for a child.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
It's really pretty outside.
Any ideas yet?
Well, something'll come.
What do you want me to do about it?
I'm not being grouchy.
No.
Did you find anything?
He's still asleep.
Somebody did that to him.
Get him out of here?
Jack!
I...
I don't know.
As soon as possible.
Of course I am.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Stay away from me!
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Stay away from me,
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
I'll bring back a doctor.
Mr. Ullman?
Very nice to meet you.
Have any trouble finding us?
JAck, just make yourself at home.
Let's see, where were we?
Only in a very general way.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.
five months of peace is just what I want.
I don't believe they did.
Well, obviously some people can be
Good morning Jack.
Good.
Right there.
I'd better collect my family first.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.
This is the staff wing of the hotel.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Thanks.
Hi.
What time does the plane leave?
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Lowe's car-?
Can I tell you kids something?
The moon's not down yet...
What's the money for?
Yes. Go away.
Marty?
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Please, Uncle Al.
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Are you all right, Marty?
You booger.
Not bad, huh?
There's something else scary.
I've been hearing noises in there.
Well, it's probably nothing.
Ralph Houk!
Mom-!
You all right, Marty?
Yeah, okay, the fireworks.
Your mom's not around, is she?
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
You gave me a heart attack, Marty.
What is it?
It came for me!
Yeah? Really?
I suppose so.
What if I say no?
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
You kids go to bed on time!
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
Really.
Yeah.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
But how?
LET THY SPIRIT
He's... dreamy.  He's...
SING!
But I'm fearful!
So, hi there.
How come?  Sister?
Well, what about the sex stuff?
How are you doing.
What do you want?
His ashes?
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
Okay, Christy -- strip.
Come on -- stay.
You are so damn sexy.
I want us to be together.
What? 
Babe, it's not me!
No... it's fine.
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
She's afraid.
Right here.
I was good to you!
Oh, girls.
Isn't it a glorious morning?
Where did that come from?
1961?
The minute I saw you.
Mary Clarence.
Shuttle, beat, shed.
Is this... choir practice?
Hold on.
You see?
Two days.  An hour or so.
That machine.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
All right, I am, I know it!
What is it, Mary?
Jackpot!  Two buckets
Hurry, Sister!
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
Which convent?
What?
Shirelles.
Soprano or alto?
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
Very nice.
Yeah, for one second.
Of course.
I don't know.
It'll be hell.
She's a pro.
Is there any syrup?
We could cut a demo.
Van Cartier.
JUST SING!
Come on, we're late.
What?
What?
Thanks.
You have to help me
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
Mary Clarence!
We need experience.
Bobs
I have to do this.
Who are all these people?
I'm getting experience.
Those people are wonderful!
Mary Clarence!
Goddamn it!
Oh my Lord!
What was all that?
What?
It's contraband.
Are you leaving us?
The Council of Cardinals!
Wait, this isn't the way.
Run!  Take off!
But what do they want?
Mary Clarence!
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
A convent?
St. Anne's?
Miss Van Cartier.
It has come to pass.
Fine.
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
How about a robe?
Excused.
No!  No!  I can't do this!
And the vow of chastity.
Is this all the food I get?
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
You were right the first time.
Yeah?
Deal with it, sweet thing.
A balloon and a banana!
Sometimes it's not enough!
Really catching on.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
So... hi there.
Mary Robert's life was in danger!
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
I was thinking Las Vegas.
But... wait a minute...
You sent for me?
Hey -- your prayers have been answered.
What are you doing here?
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
Then I guess you're stuck.
I don't think so.
From Vince?
He's a businessman.
Right between the eyes!
I don't know anything about bodies!
And if I don't?
Ten flights?
Okay, here's what I want.
I hate you.  I totally hate you.
Nuns, Eddie.
And one bullet.
I just need a few more weeks,
Do you hear that?
What'd she say?
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
Well.
I've got to go.
Vince knows you're here.
I can't go with you.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.
They need you?
What're you doing?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch.
Hey, girls.
We could put you into our witness protection program.
Then one day they find you.
Jesus.
We're looking for Mike.
But you didn't tell me!
A nun?
Vince -- is she... okay?
And if she runs?
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
It's done?
I can't believe this.
Well?
Right.
Get her!
There she is!
I can't see anything in here!
Joey?
So that guy in the bar was right?
She's gettin' away!
You didn't shoot!
Strip down a nun?
A sweater.
What's she doing?
It should be here any minute.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Look what she did with the choir.
We've got to save her!
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Sister Mary Patrick?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
Bless her!
She shouldn't have come back.
She told us about one.
Peace on Earth.
Is this like your old convent?
Mary Clarence has a background in music.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
He's not like other guys.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
Ice cream!
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
We can't sing without her!
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
An... entertainer?
Well, I don't care who she is.
It's so beautiful...
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Not a note.
I don't understand.  Where is she?
Calm down.
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
Reverend Mother?
Absolutely not.
I mean, won't she talk?
She's a nun, Vince.
And who are you to talk?
She's... she's a nun.
We both missed.
Where?
If we could speak alone.
Who took the meat?
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
Um.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.
Certainly not.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
What the hell are you doing?
They spend two days in chains.
An honor, gentlemen.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
No bleeding.
We must be a curious sight to him.
He is a behemoth.
The wounds are the same.
Keep still, Constable.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
... help yourself, you pompous ass.
Stains of blood.
No clotting or gathering of pus.
Why not tell us what you have heard?
It is sacrilege!
I will not allow it.  I will not!
For poaching.
Only if I repeat them outside this room.
Taken.
Do you have these persons' wills?
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Maybe you should take this.
Damn... damn... damn...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Just a moment.
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
Very few, if any.
Master Crane, sir.
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
The Widow Windsor.
... found the body this morning.
What is that you wear?
Listen to what you say....
I am not here for revenge.
What is the common thread between these victims?
Where are we going?
What is it?
Out there.  What do you see?
Are you familiar with magnets?
It's spectacular.
Thank you.
What is it?
We are leaving.
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.
We should not go much further in this murk.
What is it?
Must be some sort of gateway.
Someone left last night.
What good is this?
My father had farm land.
Only the heirs were killed.
There is no Masbath here.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
There are no other doors.
What now?  Where is she?
Won't you change your mind, sir?
Why... why are you like this?
This is farewell.
Climb up!
What can we do?
What now?
How are you?
Forgive me, I didn't know.
Did they tell?
Not all think it is the Horseman.
You do not disturb me.
These scars.  How did you get them?
Here it is.
He only appears to be inside the cage.
Oh, you are hopeless.
Thank you.  No.  Here...
You promised justice.
Why would you do such a thing?
Allow me some time.
It is only me.
Blood.
What are you doing?
My God... what has happened?
What... what are you doing... ?
What is so urgent?
I have been reading your journal.
Katrina...
Where are we going?
The church.
What was that?
Ichabod...
Quickly, close it.
The blades will carry us to the ground.
You said yourself.
Returning to the Western Woods?
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
I know you saw me.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Van Ripper.
There was not much blood, was there?
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Pardon.
I hear him.
Can you help?
What... what are you doing?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
You... you are alive.
He rides tonight.
Go home.
All right then, I'll see y'all later.
I can go.
Thank ye.
I don't reckon.
Yeah, they's good all right.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Thank ye.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'.
Don't look much like he could.
He won't steal.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
I'll see you, Bill.
Can I help you?
Did you decide, sir?
These dang things are heavy.
My name is Frank Wheatley.
... on the third day I washed her.
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy.
Doyle, you're awful.
Let's go, Vaughan.
You know what, by God?
Well, it's on!
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both.
He don't want to Doyle.
You're not stayin' here tonight.
Leave.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'?
How'd your baptizin' go?
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
I ain't sure.
I want to watch T.V.
Stop it, Doyle!
Stop it, Doyle!
What have you got to be nervous about?
Okay, I'll leave and sober up.
Now here's the deal.
Sure, I guess.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard?
You like that Vaughan?
Are you sure you can drive?
You got that shit right.
We don't have a goddamn band!
I'm a witness.
What's in your bag?
I want to be baptized.
Don't hit that boy no more.
Where's ever'body else?
Hey Frank.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too.
Can you go there with us now?
What's you last name?
Do you like to play football?
Hey there.
Wait a minute.
Karl.
Hey Karl, you off work?
She said she'd see me later.
What you readin'?
Way to go, Karl.
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, Karl.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
Oh, that's Karl.
Hey Karl, guess what.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
I sure like the way he talks.
You all right, Mama?
What are you doin' up again, Frank?
Well, at least he's tryin'.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
You walk fast, don't you?
A blister shore can hurt.
I'm ye boy.
She's talkin' about me, Karl.
Karl, you up?
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
You scared me.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Thank ye.
Was that you?
You're a hell of a boy, Frank.
Where are you goin', Karl?
Yes sir.
Karl, what are you doing here?
What about you, Karl?
Frank, don't talk that way.
He just got out of the state hospital.
Good.
Let's just go, Marsha.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
I don't know what to tell you.
Can't you talk to him?
But, here's the thing.
Is he leaving right this minute?
It's coming along.
What!
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
Like me, too.
Will that be cash or charge?
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
And the bookstore?
Jesus, what happened to you?
I finished my story.
What'll it be, Auggie?
And what about for you?
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.
Are you closed?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
They're all the same.
Yeah.
Hey, man, good to see you.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking.
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
Don't be an ass, Auggie.
It could have been worse.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
So what did he say when he called?
Nice machine, Auggie.
It's not a long drive.
Hey, man, how's it going?
Two, right?
Fine.
I have to pee.
So. Are we ready?
Did you ever go back to see her?
What do you mean?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long.
Get in, Auggie.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
What's this?
Fuck this angel shit.
There's just one thing I want to know.
Okay.
Seventeen.
A job?
I'll be back in about an hour.
A little. Not much.
It's for you.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly.
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
Sure, Auggie, I got it.
... If it happens, it happens.
Does it hurt?
They don't come cheap, son.
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
You going to sit here all day?
I'll tell you what.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
That's funny.
Thomas.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
I don't like this.
Yeah? Who is it?
Well?
Be nice, sweetie.
Okay, joke about it.
Sure.
Of course there's gonna be a war.
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
Watch out, man.
Mostly what.
Here and there. Around.
I didn't expect to see you again.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
Time to wake up.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise.
I'm sorry.
Hey, it's you.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
Celebrate? What for?
Here we are.
Yes, an invitation.
It's 1942, right?
I don't know.
So you lost the job.
Cuban cigars.
Here's what you're going to do.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Hi, kid.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Yeah, give him another one.
I'll take the iced coffee.
How do you want that cooked?
Seven acres.
The battery's in, that's done with.
I am a bastard.
Bits of blood and wood.
I don't know.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.
And when he came home.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
Just three questions.
Now, Mister Gi...
Now if you wanted to kill a man.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Boat has two batteries.
Thank you, Mr.
I said 'excited'.
We hear how Carl.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
He's still got a good grip.
I told myself that was good.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
It's just Pearl Harbor.
We all expect the world to be fair.
I couldn't say anything.
I'm married, Ishmael.
Did you write that column?
You don't believe in God anymore.
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
Well, what then, sergeant?
And your evaluation of the defendant?
Did you say more?
Objection.
You're a hard man to trust, sir.
Maybe it went.
Well, the freighter.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
Your line of work.
Greedy.
Robbed.  He was angry.
Mr.
But Carl was a fisherman.
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.
Yes.  Initially.
I should have told everything right away.
My apologies.
I see.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
How long you have this detail?
You mean, early morning the 16th?
They got transferred that day.
I did.  Boy.
You said three minutes.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
It's on the twine, too.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
He's looking down.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
That's when he fell.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
Still and all.
You think so?
Cigarette?
If I whistle.
We don't let go, you s...
What for, Sheriff?
You always run with the well open?
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.
What makes you think I play?
White or black?
You must think I like losing.
You wouldn't even see it move.
And what's that?
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh?
You want me to say that.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.
You found three batteries, you say.
I believe so.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well.
So this.
In your motorcycle example.
For certain, no.
Can I say something, here?
Are you absol...
So your husband said he's think it over.
I guess you'd have to guess.
Those 'dirty looks'.
Sorry about that, Mrs.
Improved...how?
Melton, on the double!
Are these your bags?
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.
Those idiot broads!
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
I beg your pardon.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
Upsy-daisy.
No --- how does it go?
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Okay. 
- so the one-legged jockey said - 
Cut it out, girls.
What happened?
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth.
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Well, that solves one problem.
Greased Lightning!
Yeah - where were you?
Nellie told us about it.
You mean it's a girls' band?
No.
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
I think they got me.
Where are we running, Joe?
You going to call the police?
How can they walk on these things?
And it's so drafty.
It's no use.
Who are we kidding?
My name is Josephine.
DAPHNE?
Hello, everybody.
How about that talent?
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
This way, Daphne.
I changed it.
Bye, Sugar.
Forget it.
Men?
Steady, boy.
What are you doing?
Good night, Daphne.
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
What happened?
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
What is it, young lady?
You know - the old shell game.
Wise guy, huh?
I'm a push-over for whom?
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
Come on, you can do better than that.
What are you doing with my flowers?
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
Hey - these are real diamonds.
That's some nerve!
Not that, you idiot.
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
Hello, my dearest darling.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.
You crazy or something?
All right - so what do we do now?
Did you hear that?
What'll I tell him?
It's all fixed!
OH!
That's us.
She sings, too.
We'll take a rain check.
Are my seams straight?
Good night, Sugar.
Oh - Sugar!
And that's one of them.
You all right?
Who needs vermouth?
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Not you, Sugar.
I'll carry the instruments.
Here you are, Sugar.
See?
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
What do you think you're doing?
His yacht?
Oh, please do come.
Well, I'll be - !
We don't have to run.
Josephine -
What do you mean, maybe?
No!
Did he get fresh?
How did you get that bracelet?
Brand new.
Where did you girls play before?
How did those holes get there?
I was it.
It's about the Florida job.
What's wrong with us?
We could pass for that.
Yes, I'm holding on.
Hello, Mr. Morris?
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
Please.  It won't happen again.
Well, I'll be - !
Daphne...
Another bridesmaid?
This is her roommate.
The New Caledonia.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
I don't like no witnesses.
Anything today?
Oh?
What's the job?
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
What are you - a couple of comedians?
The wrong shape?
No, we couldn't!
Well, here we are.
We got it second-hand.
We got time off for good behavior.
Tell what?
Yes.
Running away?  From what?
We understand.
Put it here.
Happy days.
What's happened?
Okay, Sugar - all clear.
Thanks, honey.
Wait a minute, Daphne.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Which one is yours - the big one?
How's the stock market?
Would you mind moving along, please?
Well, I guess I'd better go -
Josephine.
The most wonderful thing happened -
One of whom?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
You heard her - yes.
Been waiting long?
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
I seem to be out of gas.
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
Oh - in here.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
Champagne?
Look at all that silverware.
See?  Nothing.
Is that anything?
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Would you do me a favor?
Anything this time?
You're not giving yourself a chance.
Well - ?
I think you're on the right track.
I never knew it could be like this.
Good night.
Oh, no.
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
Really?
That's funny - I never slept better.
Yes, they're here.
Oh.
What's the matter, Sugar?
Daphne -
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Good evening, sir.
What'll it be, sir?
Okay, Spats - the services are over.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Hi, Spats.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Too bad, Charlie.
You know what I love about all this?
Perfect. All ginny.

Do you want to come in for a minute?

Hey, man.

Hey, Kat.
Hey, you!
So, tell me, hows unmarried life?
Whoa, Jeffrey.

Youre not even listening.
Bollocks, Im sorry.

Im sorry?
Hi. Hey.
You think we look like were trying too hard.
What color are my shoes?
Dont patronize me.
Mission accomplished.
Mmm.

What did he say exactly?
No, count it, anyway.
Six thousand, right?

Have you ever done anything like this before?
Not the way youre thinking.
Not you.
Sorry.

Would you grab my shampoo?

So.
Yes.
Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?
Theres a guy on 81st and Madison.

Subtle?
Its hard to explain.

Dont they have a limit at those machines?
So youre telling me.

You have had girlfriends?
Yeah. You?

Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
You let me make a fool of myself!
Youre right.

You didnt have to do that.
Whats he do anyway?

Oh, no. He told you.

Thats not true.
So whyd you let him go?

Sheila, you're going to far!
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
Shiteater-
My fellow Americans.
And Bill?
You're all part of Satan's army now!
I am the dark master!
What did my son say, Principal Victoria?
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?
We must take action on this immediately.
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
How is the children's progress?
What?
It's from your mother.
You'd fuck your uncle!
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
HA HA HA!
Hello, Conan!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
Fight the power!
Oh, you are such a maroon!
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
What's going on Terrance?
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
AGH!
Oh, a new recruit, huh?
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell!
Who's my cream puff?
Yeah!
You know I do.

This is the millennium, Saddam!
What if I just left?
Hey, I'm missing the party!
No, Saddam.
Help you?
Ow, you're hurting me!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Did you see that, Wendy?
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Yeah!
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
Hi Wendy.
NAZIS!!
Wendy?
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
Stan, I never cared for Gregory.
What is it?
You don't have watches?
Got it.
Oh my God, what is he doing?
Will you two please stop it!
Getting drunk is no solution.
I think we're moving.
Jesus, come on!
Evening.
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Well, it was nice meeting you.
No, I think hygiene is important.
Where the hell did you come from?
Weren't you down in the dining room?
Yes he did.
And what are they doing now, Mac?
Were you going to give it to them?
On channel 10?
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
Why should she, it's her fault.
What did you say to me?
All too well, captain.
No, I just ran it!
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.
You're certain of that?
So, are you on for the next one?
You gotta think of your old age.
Man, I'm hungry.
I think I can handle it.
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
If anyone can hear me please respond!
It's still not going to work!
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Look we gave you what you asked for.
Idiot...
Barnes?
Well that's your call.
It's time we lock coordinates.
So, what are we waiting for?
Is that clear?
Look at this...Jesus.
Well, more power to you.
We're going to die.
It's getting hard to breathe...
So you were looking for a new challenge.
Well, let me put it this way.
What are we going to do?
We don't.
Supposing we could get out of this room?
OK...it's open.
Damn it.
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
We could send Mac.
He certainly is polite.
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
Everyone just stay put.
I can't let you do that.
I don't know what we're facing.
Are you ready?
Yeah.  We did it.
You're ready for the real thing?
Explosive?
Taylor?
Do you want some advice?
Dawn!  Dawn!
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.
Oh my God.  What happened?
What's that?
Take this flare.
A little dab'll do ya.
I'm not going with you.
And what are you going to do?!
I will once I get past the bulkhead.
Dawn.  Come in.
I'm in the bridge.
He's out of the equation.
What the hell are you doing?
So close...
I never thought this would happen.
Will you marry me?
In that case, I accept.
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.
What is it?!
I'm fine.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.
What is happening around here!!!
Carlo!
I'm going back for Taylor!
I'm homesick.
Well now what are we gonna do!
It's getting too cold in here.
Look.
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
Again with the orders from you!
I tell you, something's not right here.
What the hell is that?
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you.
I need you to actually do something for me.
How is it looking, Mac?
Is it safe for human transport?
I'm an addict.
I'm looking for a man.
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared?
You a mini-golfer?
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles.
Heh, heh, heh.
Sorry about your loss.
After we ID, we bury the body.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Three whips. To go.
Hey, you still here?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
Your pop said to put these on his tab.
You know, Elvis bowled.
How do you turn this thing off?
Hello Mr.
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
The Faz sure took care a her.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues.
You look like you're something on the lanes.
What's on your mind, Miles?
This scam we got going here was your 
Buzz Fazeli.
I got suspended when I was young, too.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59?
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods.
Where'd you get this ball?
Who are you? Who sent you here?
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
Theo.
Watch out for that one.
What the fuck is this?
I do what I gotta do to survive.
What makes you so sure it was me?
We ain't married no more.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
So, eh, you never saw me.
Oh sure.
He's the guy Buzz.
Son?
My poor baby!
Hello?
Don't tell me, John.
I don't like to talk about it.
Knock-knock.
Who's there!
JUNIOR!
It's not so bad.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
Junior's a problem child.
Come on, Junior.
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
Hey, enough fun and games.
So you're Buzz's boy.
That's some pinfall.
Think of this business like a big aquarium.
Rac.
You already have a partner Mr.
Where's Junior?
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Fantastic! What talent.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
I get them while they're young.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Hole in one!
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
Get that outta your mouth!
He's not here.
Careful with that one.
What's your specialty?
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Do you know where they're taking him?
This is a vicious cycle.
Mind if I cut in?
Do you talk with your mom?
What are you going to do about your brother?
Then it's true, isn't it?
Nothing.
These open the back door.
You told Junior that we did it.
How do you get this thing down?
Where are you going?
Why did you come back?
Say something, Theo.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
Very professional.
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
Some unfinished business.
You guys got something going on downstairs?
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Very good, busyboy.
You should probably hit the road.
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin?
You faked my dad's murder.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
They're warm.
Fletcher, get away from there...
How big is this spacecraft?
In basic English, what does all this mean?
There's heat coming the door.
Hold on --
Not everything.
I am not leaving without him.
Norman!
The surface ships will be back.
They told me about sixty hours.
Nobody move.
I'm not sure.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Direction's east coming!
A squid?
Where is it?
What was that?
Increase positive pressure!
Don't do it, Norman!
Don't pull it, Norman.
Don't do it!
Norman, please!  Don't!
Thank you, Colonel.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
What have you been told so far?
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
Good.
We're moving fast considering the storm.
How deep is he?
What is it?
See this?
They pressurize us with helium.
What is it, Norman?
Picked up something?  What is it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
Harry's missing.
I'm not paranoid.
He translated it wrong.
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
Edmunds?
What for?
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
You think he killed Edmunds?
Going active.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
I see it.
Can you open that panel?
It's not sucking, sir.
What caused it?
Get him out of there.
Subs are still at surface, sir.
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
Any sign of Harry?
Nothing, sir.
Yes, sir.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
Edmunds, get in here.
How much damage?
It's chipped.
Ted?  Captain?
No.
So how do we get it open?
So?  What's the problem?
Gimme a report, I want --
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
Not now, Beth.
What?
With an "o".
Edmunds?
A half a mile long?
I'd also like it noted --
Ted, get her away from the door.
Look at this.
Some sort of lead or something.
What's wrong?
We had considered it.
Time travel.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
Can I stay, sir?
Did you hear me, sir, because --
How can he be missing?
They switched us over.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy.
From the sphere?
I want a name.
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
Edmunds?
What is that?
It won't register.
Do yourself a favor, Norman.
You're next, Norman.
400 years ago?
Norman!
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Where'd this come from?
What?  Why...
I didn't do anything wrong.
I can't feel her bones.
Norman.
... He lied to us.
You said something to him, didn't you?
Beth --
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Forget the sub.
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
You fixed my suit?
What's the matter?
Still clear?
... what do you mean?
You get it straightened out?
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
Page 87.
He translated it wrong.
Looks like some sort of code.
Diphenyl parlene.
It's for motion sickness.
Riordan?
It's an idea.
You ever given an injection before.
I'm sorry.
What is it, Norman?
The sphere looks different.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
What's wrong, Norman?
It's getting cold.
How do you feel about snakes?
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?
Don't, Beth.
It's your choice.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.
Of course you're going to deny it.
Beth!
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Beth, stop it!
Then where's it coming from?
Stop it!
Beth?
You can't stop it, Norman.
What is that?  What are you doing?
Would it work?
Pussy.
No.  I don't think so.
I don't get it.
Well, what's your theory?
Norman?  Where's Norman?
He doesn't wait for an answer.
Pry the thing open?
It's empty.
Then what is it?
What are you looking for?
Jerry.
Just in time, too.
Our habitat, I mean.
Why are you looking at me like that?
When did it come across?
How are you feeling, Norman?
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
C'mon.
C'mon, Norman.
Nice work, Norman.
Our answer.
This answers one of our questions.
I mentioned it in my report.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
I can't believe that, Harry.
I can't.
What is that?  That noise?
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
Norman?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.
Getting anywhere with those?
... you there?  Norman?
Thank you.
She's cracking, Norman.
Wisconsin's your answer.
What is it?
It's the squid!  Stop it!
Did I kill her?
Fine.
We're never gonna make it.
I can't reach her.
Push her, c'mon.
Missed.
Hold on.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
C'mon, Norman!
You know how to work this thing?
How's that working out, by the way?
There is one possibility.
What'd you say to him?
She told me what you said, Norman.
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
Alot like.
English?
You don't think it does?
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
An American spacecraft?
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.
Well, if it's a discharge --
What'd you say?
Good idea, Ted.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.
Norman Johnson.
How are the others?
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
I'm in psychology.
Must be another Johnson then.
He wasn't feeling well.
You want me to try?
Strange, isn't it?
He's manic, Norman.
Well, he's polite.
What was it?
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.
What kind of a crash was it?
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.
Well, we'll see...
The Empire must have gotten here first.
No, not anymore.
How much do you think she's talking about?
You have your father's style.
We're into the second perimeter.
I'll get the information.
Darth Vader is on this system.
Don't look at me.
Good morning!
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
Who are you anyway?
You're General Kenobi?
I don't see why.
I know who you are.
I.
You were right.
We don't have that kind of money.
This is the last place.
What's wrong?  What's happening?
Are you all right?
Are you sure you don't need it?
What is it?
I can't see!  How can I fight?
What about the princess?
The Kiber Crystal.
Of course, where you been kid?
You're Starkiller?
Six hours, huh?
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.
We don't get many visitors.
Here come six more... grid two!
There are only three or four left.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
We must hurry to the base.
What about us?
Organa Major is a rebel system.
You got yourself a ship.
Who's the pilot?
I found it... It's just not there.
You can't!
Maybe you should just drop us off.
Well, I practice a lot...
This isn't going to work.
Something has happened to them.
I think she's going to be all right.
Is he afraid of the water?
Watch it!  Move back.
It's only light that doesn't affect it.
Get to the ship!
Enough!
The 'Death Star' has become operational.
No!...
What is it?
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
And you?
There's a lot of carbon scoring here.
You've been in the Counter Wars?
What happened?
I think we're going to need them.
Let him have it.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.
See Threepio... do you copy?
Wait a minute, slow down!
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
Thank you, sir.
You got some guts for a rich kid.
No, this hurts.
Mobile Infantery rules !
Lieutenant's bought the farm.

We got reinforced.
We'll take this high ground.

Did you read her mind ?
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
How do you make him do that ?
Ten of clubs.
I don't believe it !
Please continue, Sergeant.
You don't approve.
Hope you're ready for more.
You always told me you couldn't do human...
Are you alright ?
So what are you doing later ?
I'm all ears.
Johnny, this is Zander.
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Or...?
Thanks.
Profile's wrong... there.
WHERE IS IT ?
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
Johnny, wait...
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ?
I was thinking.
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers.

I thought I was dead.
Zander, what are you doing ?
Good for you.
She's flying starships !
Eeuch !
35% on the math final !
You can't walk me home.
Isn't it great to be in love ?
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
None at all... We won.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
Are you the boy for me ?
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
I love you, Carmen.
I wonder where Carl is.
He was in the group with me.
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Games & Theory ?
Let's all make a vow.
You're late.
Poor boy.
You talk to Carl ?
I'm gonna miss you.
Com'on, just say it.
Do you mean it ?
Shhhh...!
What happened to your hair ?
It's funny.
What's wrong with you ?
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
...I'm sorry.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
Well, look at this.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?

Which way ?
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
Steady as she goes, number one.
Report.
Where'd it come from ?
This isn't random or light.
A lot can happen in three minutes.
What ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
Man, they're defended... no way in.

Oh, my, what's that ?

Mr. Rasczak.
A trip to the Outer Rings.
Wait a minute !
We must be right over the colony.
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there !
I don't understand it, Lieutenant.
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Smith, GO !
Is that your signature, Rico ?
No talking please.
Are your parents currently citizens ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ?
Wait you two.
Well, yeah, sure...
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
Don't get any ideas.

Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
We're outa here.
What do you think you're doing ?
Let's go.
Can you walk ?
How bad are you, pal ?
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
Don't be a hero...
You.
Mister Rasczak ?
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
All dead except one, sir.
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico.
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now.
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Warm it all up !
Sergeant, secure the boat !
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Hit your jets, sir !
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet.
This is my farm.
Who is...'V'ger'...?
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Find the Creator?
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
The examination is a normal function.
<U>Why</U>...?!
Disclose the information.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
Our data is being prepared.
What does that mean?
Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit.
A machine...!
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
And when V'ger melds?
Departure angle on viewer.
It is a courier, Captain.
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
Sir!
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
I'm taking over the Center seat.
That's why you're staying aboard.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak.
Programming ready?
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Then you acted properly, of course.
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
That's precisely the point, Captain.
<U>Computer off</U>!
The ship is under attack...!
Why bring us inside?
Captain, what's the next move?
Exactly.
Forward motion, Captain...!
Hello, Ilia.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!
Was he difficult?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
'Commander' Decker?
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Time to impact...?
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
Mr. Spock?
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
One hundred kilometers...
Viewer ahead.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr.
Hold station...!
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you.
We're losing the pattern...!
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
Let it drop, Bones.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
We cannot break free, Captain.
They had a pattern to follow...
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!
Were you right?
What should you have known?
Child...!?
Not for us?
There's no way to know.
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Dock control reports ready, sir.
Negative helm control, Captain!
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.

Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
Bobby, don't say anything.

Are you all right...?
Her...
What else?
Are you Okay?
You do...?

You guys had better leave us a...
I'm very sorry to...
It's a formality.
Aren't you ever in school?
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
No.
It's a mistake.
Get him on the phone.
I want you to hear this.
You have no right to...
You can't treat me like this.
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
Look.
You have to hide.
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
Claire, when did you...
We're just talking about the...
This is Joe White.

Not now, I'm talking to the press.
Hello.
You show Claire these sketches?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
Kiss my ass.

We can't shoot in the Old Mill.

You can't write it?
She doesn't show her tits!
How do they know that, you told them?
What is that...?
You cool the broad out?
<u>Stop</u>...
Marty...
It's just a formality.
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.
We got the permit.
She wasn't in...you were al...
Yeah?
Wally...?
Mmm.
Yes?
Do something.
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
...we don't have thirteen at table...
Where the hell have you been...?
I've got two days to get this house...
Well, these things happen.
You hear that?
...the damn thing...
She coulda done better than him.
Where are we?
We have to lose the window.
We need a new name for the movie.
Why?
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
Ben!  What's wrong?
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
So what's up?
I'd rather be with Mommy.
I didn't say that.

It just slipped out.
I'm gonna call him.

Daddy was washing Rachel.
Well, not exactly s...
Scream.
How would you know sh...
So why are you asking me?
Because it's quiet.
Look she's upset --
But we do have a choice.
That happens.  To families.
Wow.  Who's that for?
I hope it's the right kind.
Actually.
And don't tell her I told you.
We make mistakes.
I can't hear you.
I said...
He wouldn't know.
What's Thursd...
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
And what do you do wh...
He's not even there.
This'll work, huh?
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Annabelle...wake up honey...
I don't want to say goodbye.
Thank God.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?
Are you afraid for me?
You forgot to wash my purple shirt.
No.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
You swore.
I'm sorry, okay?
I don't have to listen to you!
The timing was off -- I need this light.
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.

Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
Help me here...
Uh.  What is it?
I hate her.  I really hate her.
No they're not.
You do NOT run out on your moth...
You know, this horse smells really bad.
...your hating me.
Oh my God.
No!
You touched it.
But you told us to starve.
...EGGzactly.
Excuse me --
I made you some cocoa.  See?
...for Christmas, okay?
IS THAT YOU?
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants?
I hate snails and blue cheese.
Queen of diamonds.
Poof!  You're happy now.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
Mommy?
Not a lot, sweetie.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.
That I do.  Always will.
I'm fine, ba...
No.
Mommy's sick, guys.
Grammy had a different kind.
So you're okay.
Ben!
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Okay.  These are good.
Find the bird cage?
If a soldier loses his legs in a war.
The world.
Right here.
It's not good enough.
People beat it, don't they?
So we'll...radiate some more?
That's necessary, huh?
I have to get dressed.
Why would his worry?
Congratulations.
I've got it.
Which part of no don't you understand?
Planning on getting --
Are you here?
Napalm.
Thank you Mrs.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
Our children.
Called him.  We set an ap...
You know the kids aren't really in danger.
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
Still, please.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
I grew up, a little.
She's a charmer, you'll see.
It's temporary.
You want us to take him tonight?
I know.
What happens next?
How do you hold down a job?
What happened with Annabelle?
Machines do not EAT message.
Yeh?
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
...in.
I have a snoop.
She already hates me.
So why did y...
I have an appointment this after- noon.
However many.  It's not enough.
Bandaids for cuts.
I'm sorry, I just...
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
You feeling all right?
...thinking of going back to Random House.
...make some trips into the city.
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
I don't know wh...
My boss.
Look, you've never liked me...
Bi-coastal parenting.
Did I hear the word...
Then let him talks to me.
I got used to.
Life's a trade-off.
You bet you are.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Okay, I'm undeserving.
Small world.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
She hasn't mentioned this.
Moi?
Oh, my God.
And you said...?
Can I look at the pictures?
So.  Hopeful.
I really look like shit.
The primo stuff is great for pain.
He's relentless.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
Can I say one thing?
Yah?
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
I'm thinking.
It's just not the right time t...
I know you, huh?
My advice to you?  Don't die.
That thing you said before.
Looks nice enough to m...
Now, 'limp dick', I know.
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
You put filth in my child's mouth.
You've turned her into you.
Thanks for coming out.
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
What's this about?
I love Luke, I love the children.
I never wanted to be a mom.
You're lying.
Ben never mentioned it.
Why didn't I?
With good reason.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.
The way you cook.
Look.  I know they hate me.
Get ready.
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
It's forever you know.
Everything's gonna work out.
It's just an assignment.
They're my kids.
She's not gonna die.
No problem.
What a great surpri...
Just like to make sure.
Why in the world would she t...
She called it a fight.
Can we go sit somewhere?
I told her I loved her.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Where you goin'?
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
Out! Leave the table!
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Hey.
No prob. I'm cool.
Marty, ignore him.
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Consuelo?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
So whaddya think?
The camerawork's nice.
This is definitely better.
Don't even joke about that!
Twinkeys!
Mom?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
Marty...
We used pull.
It's all about who you know.
Sure!...
Was anyone in my room today?
What are you going to do?
We did the same thing last year also.
Well.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
You're tired of me. I can tell.
What do you want?
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
Which is it?
Reconceive.
Oh, I know, I know that.
But what kind of pull did you have?
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids.
Fuck!
I dunno.
What DO you know?
So? How was school today?
Get the hell outta here!
Scooby?
Whaddya wanna talk about?
OK.
Dad?
Hey, Mikey.
Hey, Mikey!
Hello, Vi.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
You're not.
You have beautiful skin.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?
It's over there.
It's a really nice place you have.
No, not really.
Hello?
So.
I believe it.
That's good.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
Scooby?
You want some?
You a pervert?
So like, yeahI caved in.
Hey, um, Toby?
What is most important to you?
Oh, my God, Scooby!
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
I don't know what hit us!
We got trouble.
Is he with the girl?
I'll lead.
I said I'll lead.
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
What are we going to do!
What now?
--be prepared.
Let's move it we got company!
Forget about it.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
What do you mean?
Cooper...
Now what?
I'm going first.
Well Filmore--
I have a lighter!
How well do you know this place?
How's the arm?
That's it!  Up ahead!
Enjoying the tour so far?
Go fuck yourself...
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
Come on, drink up.
Came over the satellite.
Well?
What about Cooper--where is he?
Who's Ryan Cooper?
And what exactly do they intend to do?
So, what are we looking at White?
Chemco makes many things senator!
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters.
How goes the roll call?
Have you broken it yet?
Of course it's codified!
KZ.
Where the hell could they have gone!
What's happening at the waterfront?
Are we adrift--
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
War-mongering bully!
Can I have a glass of water?
Thank you, Admiral.
Where are you trying to reach him?
What's the meaning of this?
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales.
Yes?
Damn you, de Sade!
Don't you dare touch me!
My seven body orifices????
Major?
Now, snap out of it, fella!
I did that for your own good, fella.
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
Okay, fella.
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?
I'm sorry, sir.
Yes!
Go back to sleep, baby.
I didn't say anything.
Well, that's ridiculous.
Does the threat board show anything?
Well, Mister President.
General Schmuck?
Just a second, sir.
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
I didn't speak to him, sir.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Why do you think I ask?
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.
Let me worry about that, Major.
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
I see you're playing your radio, Major.
Suppose that were the case?
Don't fret about it, Major.
I suppose they are, sir.
That about right?
What shall we drink to, sir?
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
Go on, Major.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
To peace on earth, Major.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Yes?
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
Roger, maintain.
All right.
What else could it be?
He's right.
Maximum ECM.
Then this is it.
I'm sorry, Major Kong.
A through H is correct.
Check.
Missiles!
Just the missiles.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Shouldn't be bad.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Why can't he help me now?
Roger.
Sorry, King.
Well, listen, King.
Hey, King.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Okay.
Primary arming switch.
I thought I should check out the damage first.
So am I.
What does it look like?
Listen, King, old buddy.
Check target approach.
Primary circuit is live.
Release first safety.
Second safety.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
Master safety.
Primary bomb is live.
Yes, Major.
Where'd they get you?
How do you know he's dead?
He's dead, all right.
No, look!
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
What do you mean?
We crossed the coast over an hour ago.
Who's that?
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
There's no other way, Lothar.
I think it's okay, King.
We're on course, Major.
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
At the bottom of mines?
It would not be difficult.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
We are?
Mn-hm.
Um-hm.
That was really great.
Uh-huh.
Responsibility, progress.
Typical male.
Uh, home, you know.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
Yeah, we all want to see him.
Hey!
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Oh yeah?
Stuck with what guy?
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
I don't know.
Don't let 'em fight.
Go!
You know what we should do?
Fuck it!
Hey!
Hey.
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
Ow!
Ah, you know people there?
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Yeah.
Sure.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
Really?
Come on man.
Pony?
Hey!
Hey, man.
Yeah, he's told me.
Your his publicist?
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Buff.
Yes! Free concert!
Hey! Hey.
Oh, my God, you found it.
Score! Yeah!
He paid you man.
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Look, look, look.
It's safe, come on.
Hey, call the cops!
You stand someplace else, man.
Pakeesa?
Yeah.
Hey, yes!
So tell us, man.
Yeah, we're all above that.
I don't care.
Whoa!
Come on, man.
Thanks. See man?
You make videos?
You okay, man? You okay?
Hey, play that demo again, man.
Thanks, man!
What's up guys?
Will you stand up for me?
Hi.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
You got everything right but the car.
It's okay.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
I love writing.
Mm.
Hi.
Nice to meet you Sooze.
Um, mother-daughter.
Yeah.
It's coming along.
Erica, you coming?
Two-fifty.
Can you tell me what happened?
Buff, sit.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
No, that's not what I'm saying.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand.
Tim, what are you talking about?
See ya later.
To women.
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no.
They let you out?
No?
Jeff, stay there.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Jeff! Come up here!
What?
Why we're just standing here.
No, wait, wait!
Please?
This has nothing to do with me!
God, I haven't seen you all day.
Oh! Trim it!
Was that supposed to be me?
No, not, not everything.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Yes, you asshole.
Of course I do!
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
This is ridiculous!
It was a racial incident.
What?
FUCK!
Come on.
Oh, hi.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze.
I've run out of words.
Do your covers and all that shit.
You really suck, you know that?
Hey, Pony.
The prom. That's funny.
Sorry.
So you think I should?
Great.
So who are you?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, man.
George can drive us.
I gotta take a piss.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Hey, where's Erica?
I don't know.
Why should I call the police, huh?
What about this, huh?
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Look, get down off my property.
Look Pakeesa...
Get off my roof!
Ready?
I hope you're happy!
Pony, oh my god!
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next?
Yeah, come on, play it.
Alright, alright already.
You know, that is my worst fear.
Jesus, Jeff.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
Yeah.
Soon.
I hate it here.
Is that Jeff?
You know, my mom has this saying.
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Ooh, wow, nice.
Tim?
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Well, I called Erica's beeper.
Okay.
Hey, great game Friday.
I don't, I don't remember.
Yeah.
Yes, that's right.
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Buff is funny, okay?
Forget about New York, Jeff.
Could you give me a ride?
I'm going out later.
Wait!
What?!
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
Hey!
Holy shit.
I'm in, too.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Can you guys believe this?
Another sex dream?
Di, are you okay?
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Hello?
Diane?  Diane!
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
Look, you're fat, Diane.
Oh my G-d, I read about this!
No.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
Di, it's Luce.
Hi, Jack.
Like Cocoa Puffs.
Jack, I think I should get a job.
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
I'm sorry.
...do not accept charity.
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
Madonna.
Hat-trick?
Shut up.
Kansas!
It's all my fault.
Oh, thank G-d!
NO!
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
Oh no...
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
Yeah?
Yeah?
Hey, hey, hey.
You want us to help you pick up?
Hello?
Screw Lucy!
Is that you down there?
You got that big retarded girl down there?
Really...
Yeah.
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
You sure you wanna go there?
All of you!
Bank branch!
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
I know - that's what I said too.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
I mean it.
What the hell do you want?
I hate to think where that puts me.
It must be about that appalling script of hers.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
Give me your coat.
Good party.
Sure, this'll go on all night.
Wait a minute.
Walking out on the mob.
The accent!
Hello, Mr.
This is Miss Kramer.
Name dropper.
Carefull Those are dirty words!
If I could be of any help...
Let me help you.
Hurt feelings department.
You forgot this.
Is there someplace we can talk?
No, Phillip, no.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Stop it, Artie, will you?
O.K.  Where's the cash?
It's not your career -- it's mine.
I mean it.
Look, Betty, It can't be done.
Oh, you --
Good.
Who's Norma?
Look at this street.
May I say you smell real special.
Stop crying.
Hello, Betty.
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos?
Hers.
Her own movie theatre.
Hello, young fellow.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.
Did you see them?
Goodbye, young fellow.
What's the matter, Norma?
I wouldn't know.
How much will it be?
I had some trouble with my car.
Or shall I call my servant?
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
Just a minute, you!
Are you or aren't you?
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.
How long is a movie script these days?
We've made a lot of pictures together.
Well?
You know, I'm pretty expensive.
What's that?
I want to talk to you for a minute.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
How about some evening clothes?
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
Shouldn't we wait for the others?
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Don't bend back like that.
It's a quarter past ten.
Hold me tighter.
What are the notes?
What's the matter with you?
Go away.
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
Did she read the script?
Have one of mine.
What on earth, darling?
How do you like that?
Don't you want to come along, darling?
How did it go?
He must be quite a guy.
Don't turn around.
I just came to say good night.
What are you doing, Joe?
See, you didn't believe me!
That's a lie!  They still want me!
You heard him.  I'm a star!
I just put my car in the garage.
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
You are not dressed properly.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
I made your bed this afternoon.
There is the bathroom.
I'm talking to you.
Some men are here.  They asked for you.
Whose room was this?
Hey, what's this with the door?
How come?
How is she?
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis?
What's the matter, Max?
What is it, Max?
Joseph C. Gillis?
We've come for the car.
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
All right, Gillis.
Got a title?
Oh, you're one of the message kids.
So you need three hundred dollars?
How's that about your being my friend?
Did the deceased ever threaten you?
Bring something to drink.
Wait a minute.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
If you will pardon me, Madame.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
What is the scene? Where am I?
I'm an artist, Alura.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
What does it mean?
Oh, fiddlesticks.
It must be the girls.
We'll bide our time and keep watch.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
I came as quickly as I could.
A Storm Dragon?
Why did she have to show up now?
Yes!
What do I do?
I think I'd better keep it.
Home?
I don't feel like it right now.
At last. Ultimate Power.
I don't want much, Selena.
Is this Nigel's doing?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
What's happening?
Don't leave me.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
This is my favourite place in the city.
Like it?
But be reasonable.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
Of Course I don't hate you.
Is this how?
Great!
She said it wouldn't last.
I don't love you any more.
Away. From you.
Hi.
And now?
You think so?
There's something very dangerous about her.
Wait. Don't leave me.
Before you go...
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
No thanks.
She's right. They'll string her up.
Hey! Ethan!
A little.
Finished your estimate?
You must be very popular in the neighborhood.
What is it?
To us.
Oh no, not you again.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing.
Nurse! Nurse!
This is your problem, right here.
No!
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
You've been without water for a whole day.
They want me.
Guess! Go on.
Why the empty cage?
You sure are a good cook, Selena.
Selena, I've been thinking.
Hey, where you going?
Nice to meet you.
Do you have any theories about last night?
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything.
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Can I give you a lift?
Someone's chasing him.
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan.
I sure wish Superman was around.
I've been in love with you for years.
I am almost an adult.
Superman will return it.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
What are you making:
What's a tree?
Even I have trouble with that sometimes.
You see, a tree is a living thing.
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
I can do that.
There isn't any.
She did that deliberately.
How'd you do that?
Keep an eye peeled for Myra.
Your hair looks the same.
No thanks. You go on.
Linda babes!
Why is he acting so strangely?
Lucy; come back!
Don't you believe in knocking?
What can I do for you?
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
Thank you both so much.
Cheer up, Nigel.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Bianca's taught me all!
Nigel, get out of here.
Balefire on you, Selena!
You think you are on top now.
Nigel, get lost.
Nothing's wrong with my skin.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
That was meant for me!
Who are you ?
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
I'm free.
What's it like?
Where is inner space?
They'll be grateful.
What is this place?
Shouldnt've done that.
Others?
It's lovely. . .
You look at them? How?
That horrible woman!
Zaltar, please help me.
There's no way out of the Zone.
There is a way.
Then teach me how.
You're going to take me back?
You can use the wand.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Goodbye...
Yeah? What do you want?
What?
What are you talkin' about?
Got vodka in it now.
Hiya, sweet thing.
Say, Brad.
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You look wonderful.
I can't  Clark already asked me.
You know what's the problem?
You...um...you never got married?
That song.
I just can't stand this.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Peanut butter and jelly.
I can never get a way from it.
The dog's always doing that.
He really was!
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
Hi, Lois.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Well...  Not quite like this.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Do you really know Superman?
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Hi.
So, Mr. White?
You're the best, Lois.
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White!
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Name?
Ah yes, August Gorman.
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
How many sugars?
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
Gus?
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?
Say, fella, I understand.
Gus, do you know what I want now?
Man, what is this?
Under different company names.
Wipe 'em out?
How do you do that?
Hey, boss.
It ain't.
Just hold on a minute.
And do nothing. Just sit there.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
Now...when do I get a taste?
Is this blackmail?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
Yeah? How's it look?
Remember, Gus.
You want to mess with Superman?
Awright.
How you doing down there?
Whatcha wanna stop here for?
Thanks.  Let's go
I know, by computers.
Who is she?
Who's the other woman?
You're amazing, Olsen.
All right, Kent.
Why do I have to do this?
Ricky?  Where...what...
Oh.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.
There's no rush.
The picture looks blurry.
What terrific story?
I thought you'd never get here.
Lots of things...
I'll do more than tell you.
I don't know you, lady.
Why stop at coffee!
How would you know?
I can't see anything.
Come on, will you?
You!
Oh, Superman!
I can't! It's out of control!
53.
Okay? Goodbye.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
It's modern.
85,000 dollars.
I don't know who.
Well, chum?
That's what I want to know!
I don't kiss.
Computers talk to other computers, right?
She's not his mama either.
You mean...you mean...Vera!
Small potatoes.
He ruined it!
Wait a minute!
So?
Don't you see?
That's it!
He's the only one who can operate this --
He's coming!
Yes! This time we got it right!
Jimmy, how's the -
Anybody been hurt?
Are you okay?
Lois, I usually do.
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Lois, what are you doing?
I don't?
It is kinda romantic.
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
Yeah, thanks.
A "complimentary corsage."
I was.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Where were you?
Who ????
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
Oh Clark, no!
It's true. It's true.
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.
I'm in love with you.
I want to.
Let's go to my place.
You did it.
Clark .
Blood .
I have to go back .
Don't .
Hi.
Sleep well?
"They?"
. . . Superman?. . . . .
I'll try to remember that . . .
Everything on it?
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent.
But . . ..that's terrible!
Gee. But --
Mush!  Mush!
I like trees.
You'll miss the battle of the century!
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
This way Lex.
It has everything.
Artemis? Do you read me?
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
I can't understand it!
You have been given a higher form of happiness.
Don't feel bad, Mr.
DELETE IN CUTTING
Wait, wait, wait just a moment.
He flies as well, then . . .
Superman! The --
You must be freezing.
So --  I hope you like it.
I never did this before .
Wait!
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor.
Which one would you like to join, Luthor?
You said it.
There is something more you want.
No drinks .
Put down Lex Luthor !
Hey, let's be fair.
I'm the man they're 	protecting.
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
Who is this . . . Superman?
Free!
Strange.
Then we must go there too.
So this is the planet Houston . . .
Look, they need a machine to fly.
You are master of all you survey.
He's captured Non!
General --- ?
It's brilliant.
They make my eyes itch.
You're late. Very late.
Don't tell me.
My prom was so boring.
Oh .
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Maybe I should sit this one out.
Now you try, Clark.
He's a jerk.
Then prove it.
Gee, I don't think . . .
Hello, Lacy.
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
I missed you.
Oh . . . my . . .
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
You'll find a good man Lacy.
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
No Paris?
The President is about to speak.
Oh, probably just a picture request.
It's just a bad flu, really.
Superman? Has something happened to him?
Close the curtains.
And what do we get out of it?
Impossible? Why?
Well, I don't understand.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Awesome!
Well .
Not so fast!
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway!
Darling, it's good riddance.
Tone down our headlines?
No, Daddy.
Is he for real?
I think he's kind of cute.
But all men like me, Lois.
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
I think there's an angle.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
What's he going to say?
What's that?
Where's Clark?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Whoa. . .
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
What was that about?
He's . . . cold. . .
Of course!
Boy, are you gonna get it.
We'll all fry.
You think he'll find us.
What I need this for?
I hadn't counted on this but .
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Destroy Superman!
Nifty, huh?
Nice bit.
Stop!
Guess who?
Look closely at his cell structure.
I'm not going anywhere.
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
I'll deal with you later.
But . . . how could you beat him?
But .
I know, but  --
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert!
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day.
Ah!
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
It's very simple, Otis.
Me?
You'd better get a new alarm clock.
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
Mom...
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning.
Mother...
Do you know where you're headed?
Keep warm now.
I'd like to.
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Your bookie?
Are there any more at home like you?
See?
Hey!
Stop him, Clark!
Know what?
What now, my love?
For what?
Can I take you to the airport?
I'm telling you, I was there.
What'd you call him?
Oh, what a chance!
Listen...thank you.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
Couldn't we forget the plane?
You and your real estate.
Why does it all mean so much to you?
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
Again???
I needed this, Y'know?
Nuts. He made it.
Bet he makes it.
Shut up.
Damn!  This will get him.
What's the temperature now?
Krypton!
See?
Mr. Romance...
Meteorites!
Ahh.
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
You're happy, aren't you?
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher.
About Vesuvius.
Ready?
They stop for nothing.
Don't let me down.
No news is not good news. Y'know
You're not going to hit me?
You've been under such a strain.
She knows.
I don't understand.
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
Nothing, nothing.
Danger?
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
But you can't ignore these facts!
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
As an irredeemable criminal?
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
What're you writing, Lois?
Boy!
It's a ...baby.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
Got all A's this year.
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
It's the only logical conclusion.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
I don't know what to say.
....to feel yourself.
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Lois, the kickback story...
Easy now, miss, I've got you?
Who...who...
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Superman???
Well...flashlight?
Oh, I've got to get some matches.
What color underwear am I wearing?
I...uh...
Now then, Otis.
There.
What's the matter, Otis?
I broke the man out of prison --
And now he lies to me.
Please...
Is that real enough for you?
Well, gents?
They're killing me by inches!
I still don't get it.
Sort of.
What is this??!
Well  --  you've got me!
This is California.
At the San Andreas Fault.
Nice!
It would never have worked, Luthor.
Luthor  --
Well, that's their problem, T.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman?
Yes, we do know each other.
Yes.
Ally Jones.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
So there were others?
What...does it turn to?
I'm...so sorry.
I...don't think so.
What happened?
My name is...
I can help you.
That's my daughter.
That's my daughter.
Hi, Nicole.
I'll be back around nine.
Are you sure?
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Why would he do that?
I used to like it here.
How is Nicole?  Is she around?
So what brings you out tonight?
Well, it being so depressing and all.
I've tried to stay out of it.
No, Billy.
Have you been waiting long?
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
What time's he coming home?
What are you thinking?
Yes.
You're leaving.
Good night, Billy.
I stopped by the station a while ago.
Dolores.
I mean, the way they look.
Those are all from the fair last year.
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
You've talked to Billy?
You heard what Abbott said?
That's what he said, is it?
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
What do you think?
It's for the school bazaar.
You want a cup of tea or something?
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
How was it?
So do you like your new room?
Is this mine?
Nicole!
That was Billy Ansel on the phone.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
Hey, Billy!
The Pied Piper of Hamelin.
What's vermin again?
Nicole?
That's right.
I don't like thinking about the accident.
Dolores.
It was snowing.
I object to the form of that question.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
Note my objection.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'.
I have no questions.
Do you have a room?
What about Doreen?
What do you mean?
That's great, Wendell.
Tell me about the Ottos.
Yes.
They're smart.
Have they ever been busted?
Need a hand?
You always think you're prepared for these things.
I'm in a car wash.
DADDY!!!
Why can't you talk to me?
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Do you know what that means, Daddy?
What do you want me to do, Zoe?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Oh God, I'm scared.
Some more wine?
We do.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
Dolores?
So you're just the thing we need.
Are you expensive?
Are you a reporter?
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.
Been drinking since high school.
No.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
I will offer that report.
I was scared.
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?
You saw the speedometer?
What do you remember about the accident?
That was great.
What's so funny?
What took so long?
What's that?
How do you like it, Nicole?
The door needs a lock.
That's too high.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
It's because of the accident, Nicole.
What are you up to, Nicole?
Are you sleeping?
What do you mean?
He couldn't look at me.
Yes.
What's going to happen to Dolores?
Well, there's the Hamiltons.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
Will you mind your own business!
Where are we running?
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
He's somewhere...
Come on boys, break it up...
Did she accept?
Excuse me, Steve.
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
That's a lollipop that, boy.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
...People catch on quick to such an item.
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
You don't know that lunatic yet?
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.
Take it easy, Susie.
Does he have to be here in our hair?
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
Not being partial, are you?
Why are you trembling, dear...?
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?
Sidney is a liar!
I started to say we're drifting apart.
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
Susie, I'm sorry if---
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
Hello, Harry.
I just checked "downtown".
Say hello to Sidney Falco.
Can I come out?  No.
Mac!
I know Manny Davis.
Match me, Sidney...
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
Uh huh.
I know Steve.  No.
Well, what have I got?
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.
I got that boy coming over here.
Full of beans, ain't you?
What are you so chipper about?
Are you listening?
Sidney, I told you -
Talk to her, Sidney...
What's all the rush?
Is that a fact?
I thought he would.
Could this be that boy?
Bribing me again?
Who put this item in about the comic?
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
Avidly.  He was staring.
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Back?
Don't you know who that man is?
Don't you think I have any feelings?
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
That's the third time he's called today.
Who else phoned?
Go home, Sally.  It's late...
So what'll you do if I feel nervous?
You ought to be used to me by now.
If that's for me, tear it up!
What's the matter?
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
Where's those glossy prints you promised?
It's a habit with me.
Why me...?
You're talking very fast.
Frank, you don't listen!
No, I don't mind.
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
J.J., if you think -
Jimmy!
I tried to reach you twice -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
No more you don't!
This is big, you know.
You haven't told him yet...
Hello, Steve.
Steve, I...
No!
You going to work all day?
But I thought... aren't we changing things?
Please... let... the kids... go...
Do you know about the chip?
We should abort.
Do you have bandages?
My God.
No good.
Holy shit... you're really real!
So this other guy?
Where we going?
I'm right here.
I need a minute here, okay?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
You have to do what I say?!
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?
Swear.
Everything.
Does it hurt?
How long do you live?
Affirmative.
And that's another thing.
Excellent.
Not even of dying?
Torque wrench please.
Why do you cry?
Alriight!!  My man!
"No fate.
This is tactically dangerous.
I'll deal with the police.
Drive for a minute.
We don't have much time.
Is it dead?
Will it melt in there?
No!
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
Easy money!
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Out of the way, John!
We're better off by ourselves.
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
Mom?  You okay?
It's okay.
Yeah.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
Ready to rock?
John, get out of the way!!
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
I love you.  I always will.
They took him from me.
Kyle, don't go!
So what do you think, Doctor?
You broke my arm!
You're already dead, Silberman.
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
Can it be destroyed?
You look like handmade shit.
I'll bet.
Yes.
The CPU from the first terminator.
I must be destroyed.
Is it safe for them here?
It's finally over.
Are you afraid?
It's not just a dream.
Where do you stand on all this?
You represent the United States now.
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
What does he mean, too correct?
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
Where you from, David?
I guess you admire musicians.
What the hell are they doing?
David, need to ask you something.
Okay, better question the next witness.
You have a question for Helmuth, David?
Yes, David?
Major, that's not a good argument.
What?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz.
I was in Vienna.
Colonel.
You live here, in Berlin?
Okay, let's see.
Steve.
Think you can get me any of that?
I'm sorry.
Major, Major... he's here ...
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
I'm sorry but I have to leave.
I want you to understand why you're here.
I made no deal!
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering?
Steve Arnold...
It is now nine o'clock precisely.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared.
Please stop playing these games with me.
Come on, admit it.
I have illegitimate children.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now.
Do you know what that is?
How can I know such a thing?
Have you ever smelled burning flesh?
Helmuth Alfred Rode.
Major.
Show me.
And I see what you mean.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
Was a member of...?  Speak up?
I've remembered something else...
Yes.
But I need documentary proof.
And ask him about his private life.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
So, you never heard of him.
You were in insurance before the war.
Rudolf Otto Werner.
Dr.
Yes, Chuck?
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
Here you go.
Anything else?
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
Any one of them's ideal for home defense.
You can't to that...
I had him hooked.
What do you think?
Great.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
That bum.
I'm going to a movie, kiddo.
Compared to me she is.
Do you understand?
This is a mistake.
But outside, it's living human tissue.
Just let me go.
There's so much...
--everythingis gone.
Didn't see the war.
You cold?
Reese...you got a first name?
I caught one, back there.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
This is gonna make me puke.
What's he like?
I'm sure.
Ow!
Good field-dressing.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Bag some Z's?
Thanks a lot.
That's where we're going.
Look.
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.
Let's go.  Time to move out.
Kyle?
Is this enough?
I'm dying for a shower.
What's that?
That's good.
He'll find us, won't he?
So much pain.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
I bet you're ticklish.
What are you doing?
I don't think I like this.
Sarah.
What are you doing?
So.
And who was the enemy?
...it had no choice.
You go naked.
Why were the other two women killed?
You've heard enough.
I can help you...
Here, drink some of this...
Sarah.
Give me the short version.
Here's her driver's license.
That stuff's two hours cold.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
Same shit.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
That Silberman just crack me up.
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.
I could fight you on this.
Are you finished?
Did you play recently?
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
You don't talk to me like that.
I'm so sorry.
Don't help me, just get more napkins.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
I'm not sure how this works.
Excuse me, I need to explain...
What's with him?
Do you know what to do?
Oh, God... !
This is nuts.
You've got to be kidding.
There's got to be a flashlight.
See you around.
Where'd you all go?
Long story.
Don't even think about it.
I'll give you a boost.
There's a ladder here.
I'll wait.
This is C.R.S.
Don't panic.
You deserted me.
There goes a thousand dollars.
Never did catch your name.
That's classic.
We hang down here and drop.
Where are we going?
What exactly do you do?
Nice.
A fresh shirt...
I know the owner of Campton Place.
Goodnight.
I have a confession to make.
What are you doing here?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
What is it?
Do you mind if I sit?
Want anything to drink?
Take the picture out.
They're watching.
No!  I'm sick of this...
What is this!?
What are you doing... ?
Who are "they?"
It wasn't his fault.
What did you say?
My name's not Christine.
It's just money.
Who is it?
Who is it?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
Get us out of here...
What do you think you're doing?
They won't...
Where'd you get that... ?
What the fuck are you... ?
He's got a gun.
No!
Think about it!
Don't move, you bitch... !
Hi.
I have to get to the airport...
Hey there, Nickie.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
You look good.
For you.
Call that number.
Tell me you'll call.
I thought you'd like this.
Tell me where we're going.
What are you doing?
It's them.  They did this.
The phone's dead.
How did those... ?
No!
You know... how'd you manage the gun?
What?
Really?
No money, no identification or passport.
How much is it?
I need your car, Elizabeth.
It's just a t.
I'll explain someday.
Jim Feingold, V.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.
I don't write the questions.
How long will these take?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
One guarantee.
Get rid of them.
Look, it was just a job.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
They know you.
Drive in.
You don't need me...
Where?
I need the police.
You know, these fit... perfectly.
I've been so lonely.
Isn't this what you like?
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Thank you.
Dinner's in the oven.
You did?  How is he?
Is everything alright?
Mr. Van Orton... ?
What makes you ask?
Your mother thought he was a good man.
Goodnight.  See you home.
What's the trouble?
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
Your ex-wife.
I don't like her.
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
What the fuck... ?!
Hey... !
Anything wrong... ?
I wasn't expecting you.
Attractive...
What's happened...
Nicholas...
How concerned should I be?
Someone's playing hardball.
Very well.
He hasn't called back.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Bravo, young man.
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
I only saw Theo drive up.
The children.
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
Welcome Home Eleanor.
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
That could have been worse.
Luke, can I talk to you?
Do you need me anymore?
And those are Luke's and mine.
Is that the question of compassion or science?
It's not going to hold your weight.
You're not telling us something.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
Well, this lot is full!
I didn't do it.
We're fucked.
You used the wrong test.
Nell --
Was sure she'd be in here.
Nell!
It's still an electric shock!
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.
Are you working with her?
Why are you working with her?
Eleanor, how was the drive?
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
All the carvings.
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
Sorry.
Nell!  What's wrong?
What did it smell like?
Hmm.
Are you coming to confess?
Let's say it wasn't you.
Someone is playing with you.
What is that tune?
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
The children want me.
But you told me to look in the paper!
No.
Come on.
What'll happen to us, Nell?
You know what he's really upset about?
You hear the vibrations in the wire.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
Here's how they're organized.
What's this?
What happened?
Have either of you seen David Watts?
When do we take the tests?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Get a blanket!
Your fear of him was real.
Is she asleep?
She needs help.
Oh God, we can't get out!
I'm not going back to New York City.
What do you want?
Why do you need a chain like that?
Is there something about the house?
That's where she hanged herself.
Why?
It's make the soup or answer the door.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
It's a job.
No one could.
Not really.
Jeez.
I love this house.
A monster?
Good night, Theo.
Yes.
How could he have left without his keys?
Watts?
David?
Is it over?
Theo... Did you?
That's so sad.
Well, it wasn't me.
I've never had a pedicure before.
I'll take that as a compliment.
Are you sure?
Then who is?
Nell, what happened?
They're all in here.
What'd you come back for, babe?
Oh, Theo.
Adhara.
Italian?
I like the colors.
What's the matter?
We think someone is here.
No.
Hey.
How they goin', kid?
Same as last time -- the rest after.
What.
You should have let me do the talking.
You broke last time.
Oh really?  Where you from?
I can take care of the paperwork.
Man knows what he likes.
CQ what?
Edward Rama?
I didn't expect anyone.
Who done it, then?
This bloke she was bunked up with.
What more is there.
Coulda happened to anyone, man.
Boomerang.
Bad place, man.
What you gonna do, man?
You should talk to Elaine.
You're kiddin' me, right?
Are you a resident of California?
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
You hadda show up on a weekend.
Now what.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach.
That was one of them?
What's so fucking funny?
Valets.
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
What are we standing on?
Bring the motor around.
Steady on.
I've been wondering something.
Useless gits.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Hey, Elaine.
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Had a feeling it was you.
Why did you come here?
Sort a few things out.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that.
Disappointed.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
When did you get in?
I should really give him a call.
I already knew.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
So what's the deal.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
How did you come to have my address?
You don't seem bothered.
What did you do?
Not that I recall.
I guess you're just habitual.
Last time might as well've been the first.
Where's Big Sur?
Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
There's one thing I don't understand.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
Don't you work with Ian?
Yeah, that's right.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
Been away a lot.
Out on a oil rig.
How much.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
She's nice lookin'.
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
How'd you get in here.
He's expecting you?
So why would he want to see you.
You know her?
Is Valentine here?
Where is he, then?
Hello there.
You've made it ... brighter.
What kind of trouble are you in?
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Pleasure.
Thanks.  You, too.
What.
She could've had the deal!
Hello, Ed.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Oh, I know.
Yes?
...Yes?
...You don't like the music out there?
Hello, Rachel.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
Hi, Mr Crane.
Hello, Mr Crane.
Yeah.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
...I stank, didn't I?
...I guess I've been all wet.
...I wanted to make you happy.
...No, please.
...You are ze fahzer?
I speak to you on ze phone, non?
...Mm.
Ze girl?
...she can go up there.
A goose, friend.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
...I didn't recognize you without the smock.
You got the dough?!
...Was that a pass?
No problem!
...You bring a check?
...Yeah, that's it.
Well, there it is.
How ya doin', Ed?
...Were you in the service, Ed?
...That's quite a wife you got there.
...Ed, I...
Uh-huh.
...Oh, Jesus.
Please, Ed.
Your place?
...Dave?
...It ruined me.
...What kind of man *are* you?
Rye.
Where you going?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
...What a knucklehead.
...Money problems.
...What's so damn strange about that?
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Honey.
I don't know what's going on.
I know all about that.
Should I... should I tell you why?
...My books used to be perfect.
...Doris--
I knew about it.
OK, we forget the blackmail.
OK, how did you know?
Will anyone else say they knew?
...I don't get it.
Not guilty, your honor...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
'Scuse me, just finished dinner.
Coffee, Ed?
...So, uh, who should I--
...Probity.
Ed, how're you holding up?
I'm so damn sorry about your loss.
...Huh?
...Did you make that up?
That was quite something.
...I'm Rachel Abundas.
...Ed?
...so you tie your own flies, Ed.
...You sure, Eddie?
Frank.
...How you today, Ed?
This is what family is for, Ed!
...We goin'?
Huh?
I don't understand.
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
'Lo, Ed.
Mr...?
...You're Ed Crane?
...I'm Crane.
Hello!
Doesn't bother me.
Yes, sir.
He's a barber.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
What'd he say? Does he understand?
Uh, Vince.
Manual overrides aren't working.
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
Looks like the curse is still at work.
We all love the museum.
I'm telling you, something's wrong.
Sweet Jesus!
Forget it!
Battery's dead.  Shit.
That thing won't come after us, right?
For Chrissake, I'll do it.
Fifteen... what's next?
The whole system is shutting down!
Ippolito!  Get back here!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Who are you?  The undertaker?
The body?
We need light in here, stat.
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.
Lieutenant --
What happened to them?
Saliva test?
I don't like animals.
How big is the sub-basement?
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Vince?
I smell it.  It's here.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
This place is a maze.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
Did you hear that?
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
Lieutenant!  It's me.
What happened?!
It's still back there!
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
What's that?
What does it say?
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
What are we talking about here?
Curious.  There's something missing.
Yes.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
Come on.
This isn't a death sentence.
That Cuthbert.
What is it?
Margo, these aren't seed pods.
Like the claw.
Look at this.
"Nocturnal.
What's going on?
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
What's that?
None of that matters now.
I'm coming with you.
Come back and get me.
Dr. Frock?
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
Something tried to get into this room!
It's from John.
Where is that?
Margo, this is too dangerous.
What's that?
Dr.
You work here?
This room sucks.
We're not supposed to go back there.
I don't want to go this way.
Quiet!
We were just lost, okay?
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
Hard to read in this light.
They've got something.
Shut them up!
Stop!
Argo!  Hobbes!
There's something out there!
Look.
Oh... my... God!
Jesus, what is this?
Oh no.  I smell it.
I have the species identification on these teeth.
That's impossible.
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.
Mbwun.
What do you make of it, Margo?
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
What kind of egg is it?
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
This is it.
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
Special Agent Pendergast.
No.
Where would we find it?
What happened?
It's okay, I'm all right.
That's not what I saw.
Dr. Green...
Genetic damage?
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
You're not.  Where is it?
I don't know how to deal with this.
But what can we do?
That was D'Agosta.
Is there another way around?
Hide quickly!
What is it doing?
What happened?
We have to try and draw it off!
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.
Help someone!
You smell that?
We're not going to make the storage room!
No!
I don't believe it.
Just like John.  He won't listen.
I'm so glad to see you.
I'm sorry to keep you.
Close up?
Why is he in the basement?
What happened down there?
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
We've declared a curfew.
We're not watching the sea.
Cue music...
He doesn't care.
Welcome.
Let's talk ratings.
Are we talking Emmies?
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.
Who are you?
The creator of what?
Nothing was real.
I have a map.
What's he doing?
How can they have a child?
You take Japanese.
It's okay.
No...I, er.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
Well, what do you want to do?
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
See here, this is us.
Marlon--
I've got to talk to you.
What're we doing here, Truman?
Stay where you are!
I don't know what to think, Marlon.
What's that?
Well, what do you think?
Hi, honey.
How did it go today?
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
Where have you been?
It'd be an adventure.
This'll pass.
What're you doing down here?
What did you want?
Come on, Truman.
I'll take you home, Angela.
I have to talk with you.
Arrah!
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.
Let's go now.
Where shall we go?
Blocked at every turn.
Truman, that was our house!
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Truman, what about that sign?
Let me get you some help, Truman.
Stop this now.
Who were you talking to?!
--What are my plans now?
How are you, Mother?
You know surprises aren't good for me.
You look very pale, Truman.
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank.
Now what?
They're coming.  Any minute.
How's it going, Truman?
See you tomorrow, Truman.
Do you live around here?
Not supposed to talk about it.
I think you better tell us.
Poopy day?
What do you do?
I think that about does it, Spooky.
What am I doing here?
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
I need your clothes, Byers.
Special Agent Scully --
You've been back to Dallas?
And you have conclusive evidence of this?
I hope to.
What is it you find incredible?
You've got something to show me.
This man's still alive.
How can this be?
Yes.
Who called this meeting?
Its effect on the host has changed.
My lateness may have well been absence.
Do they know?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
Feds are looking for him, too.
You looking for him for some other reason?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary.
How's that?
Do I know you?
You follow me out here for a reason?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
How'd you find me?
And what's that?
Those people were already dead.
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
I think you're full of shit.
See this bullshit...?
I was right about Dallas.
What was it?
How can I reach you?
You found something?
What do you think?
You told me you had answers.
Mulder -- it's me --
Mulder...?
Jesus, Mulder...
Now what?
Had you.
I saw your face, Mulder.
Scully...
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
...thirteen fifty six...
Scully?
Something's not right...
I wake you?
Are you drunk, Mulder?
What are you implying, Scully?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
It's like jelly.
And there's been no autopsy performed.
Why are you whispering?
You said you weren't coming?
He didn't mention a park.
This looks like new grass to you?
Ground's dry about an inch down.
What are my choices?
You think they went left?
What?
What do you think it is?
This is weird, Mulder.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
You hear that?
Scully....?
What are you doing?
Where'd they go?
What? What's wrong?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
Why was I assigned to you?
What? What happened?
Scully...
Scully --
Cold...
We've got to keep moving.
I can't go any farther.
We're going to the morgue.
General McAddie is who requested our coming here.
Agent Mulder --
She's missing.
Are we being watched?
What are you doing?
Mr. Mulder.
Where's Scully?
What is it?
But.
Why are you telling me this?
Let me out. Stop the car.
You have precious little time.
We began to worry.
More concerns than that?
My god...
Our vaccine may have no effect!
We've allowed this man his freedom.
You can't kill Mulder.
Sing a song of sixpence...
Did we go sailing?
He hates me.
She adores you.
We've been over this a dozen times.
Miriam...
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Don't bring it home in this.
Sing a song of sixpence.
The first... What?
This isn't your responsibility.
Catherine?
Is it cold in here?
...a pocketful of rye.
Damn him.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
I'll come by tomorrow after work.
What if he wasn't like this?
There's always a chance they'll confess.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
Edward Baines, I presume.
Agent Novak?
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
With Stargher I saw things...
Why'd you bring him here?
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
What about Julia?
What happened?
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.
Wait...
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Where the hell are we?
COME ON!
That went well.
You sure about this?
I heard Julia and John got married.
Well look at that.
He's mine?
They're hungry.
Thank you.
You liked him?
What now?
Who says?
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Agent Cole.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
Not a gift.
Intravenous administration complete.
She changed the codes.
Instead of going into his mind...
When did he lapse into the coma?
What about the legalities of this...?
Catherine!
Into Stargher.  Inside...
I have done this, you know.
Nervous?
Is she alright?
Agent Novak.
How's the patient.
Someone looking after her little girl?
So?
I need it.
The dog's an albino.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.
How is she?
Here he is.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
We proceed assuming she is.
We'll go back to his house, Pete.
You sure you want to go through with this?
Right here.
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
Ich weiss nicht.
Den leuten.
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
Thank you.
You were awfully good.
But I could follow it fine.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
Oh, American, thank you.
No.
He said he remembered me too.
Yes.
...at all.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
What's she talking about?
Anything really wrong with your papers?
Oh, what was the name of that doctor?
Drink?
Harry?
Who are you looking for now?
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Can I hear you?
Do I...
Gestern bein heurigen...
H-E-Z-T...
Tell me about him.
When...what did you do?
...to steal my girl.
Oh, that was many years ago.
...and buried him.
Seemed like a good idea.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Let's go away.
Wer ist da?
I thought you were going to go away.
I'm going back home.
What happened to your hand?
...you know.
He's better dead.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
...again.
Are you going, too?
...is there?
...Headquarters.
Harry.
What is on your mind?
Here, it will be cold on that train.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
That's his headache.
...quarrel?
...anyway?
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
Nichts danke. Kein.
...parents.
Must you take those letters?
Right.
Do you know this man?
Joseph Harbin...
You can help us.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
I said another man was buried in his place.
Must you take those?
Here we are.
Thank you, you have been so kind.
Yes.
What is it?
We are interested in this case.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
Can you tell me whose...
My name is Calloway.
Back in school.
See much of him before that?
I'm afraid I've never heard of you.
Must have known I was broke.
...to him.
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
...a cop.
Listen, Callaghan.
...expense.
What the devil?
And there was a third man there.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Miss Schmidt.
Get the next plane.
A parrot bit me.
Well?
Do you see what that means?
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Next, Paine.
So would I.
...a week ago.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
...in the morning.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
It wouldn't work.
Calloway!
A girl of spirit.
Didn't I?
What time is it?
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Wait a minute - let me out.
Be sensible, Martins.
Please be careful, sir.
It's a military hotel.
Write her out a receipt, Paine.
Very good, sir.
...of Santa Fe."
Shall I go over there, sir?
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
...excuse me.
...his number.
You do!
Welcome?
They wouldn't know me.
Come upstairs a moment.
It was just a soldier.
Seems exciting.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
What's that?
Well, yes.
Zane Grey.
Mr. Crabbin.
Striptease, sir.
Very popular, sir.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Hello, Harry.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Hmm.
...exactly who did you tell about me?
Unwise, Holly...
What do you want me to do?
You told them, didn't you?
Part?
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
...this way.
Mr.
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
You really liked it?
...were of you.
...you know and all that.
...you.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
...your address?
...the best way one can, you know.
Not yet.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Are you mad?
Dr. Winkel?
Martins.
Find out?
Could he have been at all conscious?
...he was.
Speak English?
Already gone.
Coffin?
Baron Kurtz.
Excuse me!
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
...Popescu...
Sehen sie da gleich da unter.
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
Could he have been conscious?
...give evidence.
Kurtz.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
I have no evidence.
Yes, it is.
Oh, you did.
Harry...
That's all you meant?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
What else did he tell you?
He probably knows a lot more than that.
No.
Third Man.
Mr. Martins...
...this time.
Should I make it all fact?
...Mr. Martins?
Passport, please.
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Excuse me.
I'll share something with you.
Thank you, sir.
You.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
Bonjour.
The noise?
It's arranged.
He will not take us to the island.
Yes, of course I can swim.
Richard, it's secret.
I don't know - I'm American.
Everyone ok?
Richard - I saw a fin!
A shark fin?
She is gone!
She just went under the water.
What about Moliere?
He tried to borrow money from us.
One kilometer
Bonsoir.
Did you sleep well?
Hi.
So from there to there?
Have you told someone?
Francoise -
I think so too.
Too far?
We lost our key.
Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"
You think?! Based on what?
Watch your language....
They only kill them when they love them?
What's a fascist?
Fucking Danny, man...
What do you think you're doing?
Bring your friends.
What, do you like it here?
You coming?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
Oh, please...
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
What do you care?
It's called the flame alphabet.
How come you know all this shit?
Yeah, but not on the letters.
You write that?
Forget the Jewish stuff.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Which is what?
You're not in school?
Why no silencer?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
You're not like the others, are you?
I bet.
Too many good players down here.
Who's Linda?
When can I see you?
Your father??
I'm coming to your room tonight.
Where'd you get this?
How come there's no punctuation?
Va-yomer.
I want to learn to read it.
Put something on.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
No, I think you shouldn't.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Nazis talk about it all the time.
The real Nazis.
You can't.
Come on, we can be like Eichmann.
Look, just light the candles with me.
Miriam called, looking for you.
Carla?
That's a much easier game.
I thought there were people here....
Who's Eichmann?
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
Why are you taking that?
An investment banking house.
More cultural than political.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
You wouldn't announce it?
Totally.
...Insulting people who were in the camps.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
Is it okay if I record this?
The Jews are different.
Deracinate.
What?
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally.
I always won.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
You're telling me you killed him?
You shut up.
How did you get the fucking number?
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
Do you feel you're making progress here?
How have things been going?
Hello...?
What about chicken?
What are you doing here?
He's going to die.
Hello...?
Who knows what that is?
Which was his room?
Where's Mrs. Moebius?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas.
Which one were you aiming at?
What is it?
Shut up. Fuck you....
Open it up.
This will be a different kind of device.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
That's all we've got left.
Didn't you get anything?
Oh, what is this shit?
Not too fast.
When do you want it to go off?
You remember Miriam....
Who'd you kill?
How did you know they were Jews?
Shoot him in the head.
You missed on purpose.
And what did you do?
You can't say that....
SO THEY SHOT HIM!
Where do you think you're going?
It's Friday....
Who's this?
Howard Stern.
Adam Sandler.
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
We want you to help run it.
I'm not an intellectual.
Do you have a suit?
We tested the new bomb.
Are you out of your mind?!
Do you think I...
Oh, fuck you...
You're going to live here permanently?
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Are you going to keep it?
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
You're leaving?
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
Did you tell him?
This is good work.
Did the driver really freeze?
What's happened??
Good afternoon.
I tell you she's mine!
This is a great pleasure.
I wish, but it's full.
Where did you two meet?
A new world record!
You forgot the Hula!
He looks strange, doesn't he?
And just where are you from?
Huh?
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.
... It's easy.
And the lights!
Well, good night, then...
... It's a comfortable place.
Is it a poem?
Jacques!  Johana!
You risk your life when you cross the street.
... Not yet.
Is he alright?  What happened?
How did it happen?
Ten thousand.
Roberto?  How long?
Yes?
What about the shoes?
Enzo, wake up!
The medics are looking all over for you.
Where did you get that?
Is he here?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
What's with the voice?
Is that alcohol?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
That's good.
Why?
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
Well, what are they?
That's good.
No.
So, not married.
No, no!
Enzo?
Madame...
No.
Why?
Why?
Two years younger than you.
Hey!
Good night.
Here...  Here...
You still collect them?
Can I come in?
He doesn't like us.
Anybody can have a bad day!
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
That's good.
... How long was I asleep?
I'm concentrating.
It's not safe, they say.
You were right.
... Push me back in the water...
Don't you have a heater?
A drink to warm up?
I recognize you.
Please, have a seat.
But what brought you to Sicily?
No, no.
Thanks for helping with the bag.
Yes.
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
You look adorable.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
No.
Just checking up on your family.
... No?
How can you tell it's a female?
She's not like the others.
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Jacques, you set a world record.
I'm going back home.
Hello?
How are you?
So have I.  ... Hello?
Do you know how it is?
Hello?
I'm being a pain, huh?
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
And you?
What?
What are you doing?
Jacques...?
What's wrong?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
Promise me one thing.
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
This is the hotel San Domenico?
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
Why don't you ask me?
Assassin!
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Uncle Louis!
Good.
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
... And the new stereo.
Well?
It's his heartbeat.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
... Since eight o'clock last night...!
What are they for?
... And those?
Who... Who is that?
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
He's in the fluoroscope now.
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Will he understand Spanish?
Wait!  Professor...?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Chief, it's me.
It was a trap.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
So why the long face?
Please. Will you help me?
There won't be any need for that sir.
So. Do you have a name?
You like my Mordechai, yes?
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
Client notes.
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
Any sign of Santa?
What are we going to do?
That got annoying fairly quickly.
So, now what?
Want to get a drink?
What was that!?
What!?
Sorry. I'm better with men.
Mordechai?
Your mother was right.
When did you guys have this conversation?
Oh my god.
We do!
What are you doing here?
Esther!
Esther!
You two know each other?
Shabat Shalom mama.
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
Mom, I have a real job.
I don't want to argue with you.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Well I have news for you mom.
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Mom! We're eating!
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
Okay, what's the information?
Anything else?
But we're not open on Sundays.
Actually, I.
You watch your back Hammer.
What's wrong with him?
Cool. What's it do?
Man, that's far out!
Porno?
What are you doing?
Wait!
How do we bypass it?
What are you doing?
Hammer, you alright?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
What's your shpiel, Santa?
What are you doing?
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
Where's my girlfriend Santa?
What should I charge?
So what's in the boxes?
So, how was I?
I wasn't too over the top?
You okay?
Get off of me you cripple!
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
What day is it?
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Is he in love with you?
Why do you ask so many questions?
This is for "mama and the kids."
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory.
Then what do you do?
Can't make a buck without my leopard.
Where's that man?
Sure, I like my leopards
Sure!
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
I'm sick.
I don't know.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
What's left of him.
Cut.
Something black - something on its way to you 
Don't look at it!
The death card - -
See you tomorrow -
He will be waiting...
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
Love is different for different people.
Oh, Mr. Galbraith!
Show business?
Well, I'd best be off.
It's about the leopard.
There is no danger at all.
Doc -- something you said the other day --
Just a minute, Robles.
You know Charlie How-Come?
Come to look around?
Charlie and I were talking.
It could be a man.
There are all sorts of men.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow.
Come on, Charlie.
You know a lot.
Yes.
It was you, Galbraith!
Tormented -- ? Why?
What do you do now?
Why did you give up teaching?
Well, I'm next.
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
Of course.
Wait 
You can go now, Manning.
What are you getting at?
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff.
State hunters?
Yes. The lipstick.
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so 
That's a fact, isn't it?
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
Get it out of here!
You look swell in that threealarm number --
Are you all right?
Who was the other man?
Well, does everybody love us now?
Who is he?
	As long as my feet held out.
I can use them.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
Pretty.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me 
And she waited here for him?
Why do you want to stay around here?
What else do you care about, Kicks?
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks.
Confession.
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
You already know the answer to that.
No.
Kiki?
We stood here once before.
Thats right.
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
Now you know why youre here, Mr Lombard.
Three weeks ago.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I found this at your brothers.
You seem surprised.
Laurence!
Thank you for coming.
You lost my money?
Are we understood?
Minimizes the risks.
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Mr Lombard?
Are you all right?
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Mr Lombard...
Im really sorry you were not called...
Black suits you.
Or is it the other way round?
How did you break into my office, Deborah?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard.
Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah.
Youre wrong about my being there, though.
Why did you send me after Friedman?
You know something?
They found his body yesterday.
So you did talk about it, huh?
Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir.
Good morning, sir.
The word for those things is croissants.
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
You wouldnt have a cigarette, would you?
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
Is this some kind of sick stunt?
Okay.
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
A recent acquisition.
Its give and take time, Mr Lombard.
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
A little too tight, eh?
What am I to do with the packages if...
Get a pen and dont ask any questions.
What...?
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
Damn it!
...Im Emily Stewart.
Theyd never let me go.
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy.
Hi...
Weve still got the Italian...
Look at him, Whitney.
Shit!
Im calling about the puppies.
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
On the bed!
Where is the Austrian?
Youre not playing with little boys now, scumbag.
Who are you?
Whos the money man?
Ever seen him before?
What colour is your car?
The Hyatt.
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
You sure you passed on my message?
Hello again, neighbour.
Ive got work tonight, Jane.
Shes pretty... See you, huh?
I came to feed your fish.
Piss off!
Hello, Jane. Its me.
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
May I...?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
I take it your son is called Leon?
The 1,000 is on account.
Look at it this way.
What happens now?
The rooms yours for 24 hours.
Vous tes Franais?
Problems?
Lets go.
Am I supposed to know him?
Where is Friedman?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
This car needs petrol.
Youre out of your mind. Whats the idea?
Is it real?  You people are sick.
You know what, Martin?
Is this Friedman?
Trying to say something, Martin?
Its about the puppy. You got the money?
What is it?
Five to three. Youre early.
Your lady friend did.
Will you be alone?
Evening. Table for one?
This is private property.
Its wet. Will this do?
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?
What are you going to do now?
Who else knows about the boy?
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun.
Whats the date?
Now, can you stand up?
Barstows 30 miles to the left.
Welcome to the club.
Quest-ce que tu veux?
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.
Bye.
Alors?
We are so alike, Xavier.
Okay, shitbag.
Youre the lantern man, huh?
Why did you kill Friedman?
Try again, and this time be polite.
When they realise Im missing...
What you gonna do? Kill me?
Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...
Ha ha.
Oh dear, why is life so complicated?
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?
Here.
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
It's a miracle she's not dead!
What do you fear most now... my sword?
I would like some fresh straw.
And I would like to see a priest.
I also need someone who can read and write.
Who do they think I am?!
Jeanne, stop it!
What did they say?
What's going on?!
Not so.
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me?
I'll go.
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
Well of course they're me!
What did the king say?
Will you at least let me stay with you?
We must sound the retreat!
I am ready now...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
Jeanne's alive!
I won't tell you more about that.
Go onto the next question.
I can't read.
Do you have a sword?
W-w-what are you doing?!
Arrest them!
Who's running this trial, you or her?
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Really?
Quick -- hide in here...
Oh, thank you Lord!
You must take the oath!
Show us a little more cooperation first.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully.
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.
What were you doing when the voice came?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!
Please... may I have it back...
I didn't mean it!
Good day, sir.
20,000?
You will??
It's true.
Don't worry, Charles.
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
What was my mission?
... and what... what did he say?
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!
Get them out of here!
She pretends she's been sent by God!
Not exactly.
Your majesty, I really think you...
My captains have sworn their support.
5,000 gold crowns.
8,000.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Wait, wait...
So... what is the message?
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?
What's going on?
Stand by with the battering-rams...
Well...?  Shall we go?
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news!
This is no good!
And... what does Jeanne think?
Clear?
Jeanne.
Bravo!
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
Do you know how to count?
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
Besides, what about these...?
Yeah...
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
Physicians are a waste of time.
Prepare these as battering-rams!
We... won?!
You call this... glory...?
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
You don't believe me anymore?
Jeanne... what are you doing?
What have you done to me?
Who... who are you...?
I don't know... I thought...
What are you doing out here?
That's too easy.
Oh?
Why were you yelling like that?!
My... visions...
They won't come anyway.
No!
Stop, stop... I can't remember!
I don't agree.
"Love your enemies"...
Yes I am.
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?
You think you are ready now?
Good, good.
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Beautiful.
I don't want to wait for his call.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
Someone you know?
A beauty. Who is she?
This is my husband.
I'm going to get a doctor.
Hello.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Dorota!
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
Sit.
I need help.
How long have you been married?
And how's Yurek?
When's your baby due?
What did I tell you?
Will I still be able to play?
Let me see this.
For what? For my tie?
It's not going to be very comfortable.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Get your things together, you have to leave!
I'm on the run!
Have you seen this?
What's happened?
Halina?
Henryk's in there.
We're recruiting.
And suppose they take the table away?
What's this about?
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
Boys, boys...
They bombed us, we're off the air.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
No, no.
You sell anything?
It's not funny.
What's the matter? Are you sick?
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
What are you reading?
Very appropriate.
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
Ah, here.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
There are notices going up.
Five hundred.
I have to say you look terrible.
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
How long have you been here?
They're going to start the final resettlement now.
Have a favour to ask.
I tried your friends.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
You don't want to worry about that.
What the hell are you doing?
What's your work?
Where are you hiding?
What's all that gunfire?
What's happening?
Are the Russians here?
I don't know how to thank you.
What about you?
Watch your feet!
Careful! Watch his hand.
How are the lessons going?
My REAL father was a famous German composer
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
Which mountains are those dear?
Well, that is a strong opinion.
I got the good wife for you Peini.
Don't answer, he low born.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
I worry for you.
She looks tired.
What's he say?
They want more money.
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why?
You'd have to organise it up here.
T-w~e-l-v~e.
Yes, why not.
I'll have to come and hear you play.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
She has spoken to me.
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
You have to wash them.
Wash them again.
She wants to see what you can do.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
What did she say?
What?
What's in here then, lead?
Oh no, it can't come now.
She wants it to come.
We can't leave the piano
Hello, then.
What on?
What does she say?
And when is the next lesson?
He's given it to us.
Is it all right?
Play a gig.
Mama.
You the owner here?
Which way are the rooms?
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.
Yeh, go ahead.
The wallet.
Give it to me!
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
Jesus, what a bundle.
Twist!  When did you get back in town?
Twist, you know this guy?
You're late.  Where you been?
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
Straighten up, kid.
We'll put Salino on it.
Granger, this is Combs.
I just got the count.
Buck Duff.
How do you like that Coleman, huh?
I thought you blew all your money.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
No, we checked his story with a tipster.
We got word from Chicago.
Name's Danny McCoy.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd.
I know I give him four threes.
Looks all right.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
Glad to meet ya, kid.
I'm sorry about Luther.
You can't do it alone, ya know.
You just worry about your end, kid.
How'd ya do?
Everything go all right?
No signs of trouble?
How 'bout Lonnegan?
Then he drove me home.
You think he'll show?
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
What's the matter, kid?
I better do some packin'.
Henry.
You beat him, kid.
We'll use the wire.
Looks like he's sulking.
What's the problem?
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.
I'm not sure I know it.
You in?
Look at that.
How ya doin'?
Raise 500.
Raise 300.
Raise 1,000.
See and raise 1,000.
I guess I left it in my room.
Never get enough, huh pal?
I can't lay that off in time.
A half mill on an eight to one shot.
She coulda killed me last night.
Hi there, Snyder.
My end was only one.
Excuse me, sir.
You done?
What time you get off work here?
You got a back door to this place?
What does this guy want?
Looks like he missed ya.
I don't even know you.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
Twist?
Les, I got Mr.
Hooker!
Ain't seen you in months, boy.
You sure you wanna start off that big?
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.
He'll have to take a check.
You were set up, Lonnegan.
What's the matter?
Why me?
You're dreamin', kid.
You really picked a winner, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
You stayin' in or not?
You got the 400 grand yet?
I gotta talk to me partner first.
What happened to your face?
A week's a long time, friend.
What happened?
You want a drink or something?
You got nothin' on me.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
Can't do it.
Take it easy.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
We'll take it.
What is this?  I got work to do.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
What about this Rosebreen?
What's your next step, Nick?
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
All settled?
Cheer up, darling.
Darling, your father's all right.
What could happen to him, darling?
Any luck?
She's got me worrying, too.
What?
How are you?
Well!
Mind if I look around?
Oh, Andy.
Darling, don't cry.
How are you?
What is it? Has he found him?
What is it?
That isn't true.
Mother .
Don't.  It's horrible.
You took that money from Julia's hand.
Oh!
Mother!
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
Is your father still in there?
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Another Martini --
You know, we know each other.
Not that scrawny little....? 
Andy.
Your father?
How do you do?
I just wanted to relieve your mind.
Come on in.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Where did you get this gun?
Hello, Dorothy. 
Dead?
It's been the same one for three months.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Wait a minute.
How's your brother?
I'd like to see him.
Like all the rest of us.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
You can take that out to the car.
Shrapnel!
What is it, Gilbert?
Did you kill her?
Well, I've got my alibi.
How'd you people happen to pop in?
I never saw him before.
Not without a warrant.
Have you got a pistol permit?
This gun yours?
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.
So would I.
What about the suicide?
You've been there?
No proof?
What about this Nunheim?
Well, what'd you think?
Get anything?
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
"D.
What're you doing here?
Are you kidding?
You mean that body-----?
Shut up.
I said he hadn't written me.
That's all right.
You did!
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
That's ridiculous.
Good morning --
But he's interested!
Do you think that Wynant did it?
I think we may as well sit down.
Mr. Guild means guests!
Have a shot?
She drives me nuts.
Where were you?
Let me go!
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
What are you going to do?
and there she was lying dead.
We're just having a little drink.
Who's that man?
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
Oh, please, Nick.
Did you get my money?
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
Thanks, and goodbye.
But what if you need more money?
How are you?
Nothing, thank you.
My wife.
How are you?
It might.
I've done that already.
But it must have been Wynant.
I have no right to answer that.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Where's Gilbert?
But he has nothing to do with it!
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
You did... where?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!
Perfectly absurd.
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
I gotta talk to you.
I've never heard about you.
What's that?
Morelli -  You knew Julia.
What am I?  The fall guy?
So it's you he was after!
You might have mentioned me first.
Pretty girl.
What hit me?
I can't lie here.
Who's that?
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
I'd better order some food.
Sounds like a good case.
Isn't that my drink?
Where did you get that?
She didn't tell me a thing.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
She thinks you can.
But it's Christmas now.
Nick!
You idiot!
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
I'll be all right.
I wish that doctor'd come.
You're a fine watch dog.
I never saw that before.
Finished with these?
Hello... send him up.
Aren't you hot in that?
Nick, listen.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
Well, that's that.
What's the trouble, Asta?
I wish they'd stop that.
What's that?
Back to California
How long has he been dead?
I'm going to tell her.
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
I can't wait any longer.
You're going to drive me crazy!
Is that true?
Come on out, now.
I'm sorry.
That's what Mr.
Nick Charles here?
Was he a good detective?
Well, congratulations.
I'm sorry...  but...
Where are you going?
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
Where were you going?
Think we're going to do it?
Like learning Arabic?
Paper.
What's it say?
A casual one.
Yeah!
What?
Why, yes, Jaeger.
What are we going to do!?
They stopped.
They shouldn't have been here.
What are you doing.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.
What kind of mine?
We've got rope?
What if it's a Valloro 69?
Ready?
All right.  Let's get out of here.
There's nothing we can do.
Not much of a pass.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
Should be easy going from here.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Where'd they go?
And they can't fly around out there forever.
Missile!
All right.
Epps!
You ready?
You're the one with all the ideas.
You got no reason to do that!
You got no reason to hit me.
Get off him.
What happened?
Stop it!
Says he wanted food.
We can't just leave him.
You're out of your mind.
We are not at war!
We been down this road.
No navicom.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
In the flack jacket.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
You disappoint me, Epps.
They'll kill you.
Just keep quiet.
Give it to me!
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
At-at-at-at-at.
You know what?
Don't worry about Jaeger.
This is stupid.
You all want to lay off?
What!?  What!?
You think?
Don't even.
And you know what that area is?
It's war.
It's going to be cool, Wes.
Now this is war.
You're such a pussy, you know that?
But that's the great thing about Gold.
Third.
Take the binoculars.
Shut up!
They'll shoot us!
Steady it out!
She okay?
What?
It'd make their heads explode.
Look at it.
What do we do with the Humvee?
SAY IT!
Hey...hey!
What!?
What?
You didn't step on any mine.
Oh, God!  Oh God!
Where you going?
There's a way.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
My leg is falling asleep.
How's this going to work?
You're going to be fine.
When we start running suck up your breath.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
This.  Whatever it is.
You're not losing trust, are you?
I don't hear any--
Don't!
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
Well, it's Iraq.
They're doing more than slapping.
Not enough.
X marks the spot.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
What are we going to do?
If they land--
Think there might be more Iraqis?
A whole lot of nothing.
What are you doing?
Must be a compartment.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's just a mongoose.
It's not like I figured.
Wait.
What?
Why do I have to stay down here?
All right.
What the hell took so long.
Wes might be right about that.
We should head Northeast.
What are we going to do?
We got to go back.
No.
No.
First Wes, now you?
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
Epps?
Sorry.
What do you think our chances are?
Wonder how the war's going?
We can't just sit here.
I pick that way.
Getting cold.
What do you figure it is?
Well?
What did you say?
Oh, God...
Slip out your M-16.
Can't you--
Don't go bitch on me now!
An Iraqi?
What do we do?
To where?
What do we do?
What do you make of them?
...Wes...?
I didn't say that.  I never said--
Can you ride a horse?
Which way do we go!?
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
Well?
Epps.
Epps?
Australia.
Well, this is it.
He's not slowing.
Woods.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Some good ones.
Could you stop, please.
We ought to kick their asses anyway.
Come on.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
What does that mean?
What is this?
He says it's a box.
You get it yet?
Jaeger?
Jaeger?
At-at-at-at-at.
That's it.
We...we could go home with something else.
Epps, you're smarter than this.
God!
Epps, is that a sand dune.
If there's gold.  If!
This is too much.
Iraqis.
Yeah!  Yeah!
I thought we were dead.
We have to go back.
We're not stranded.
Epps...
How long we going to keep this up.
Jesus!
Is there anything you do know?
So?
We're American soldiers.
Think we can make it?
What do you think?
It's got a bottom.
You down?
What the hell are you doing!?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
Maybe we should give him some water.
So we'll take him with us.
You're going to burn up in those.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
I can't hear him.
Drug evasion with....
HUMMMM.....
Hurry up.
Control ON.
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
I'm not hungry.
What's this?  Why did you change it?
What did you get?
I don't know.
Then why did you bring it up?
I haven't done anything.
I've never been under the table before.
Look, food!
What time is it?
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
What do you think you're doing?
I can't go on like this.
What are you doing?
I couldn't turn you in, not now.
Are you all right?
They know.
no...no, no.
THX!
Then why are they holding us here?
But we need a creative dissent.
Good Lord!
There goes another of your disciples.
I thought you were through with it!
What's going on....what are you doing?
I can just barely see him.
He's coming back for the rest of us.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
We must escape.
I can't see him at all.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
Well?
I've got it!  Astounding!
Why did you have LUH come here?
I don't understand.
I won't have another mate like ONA.
What are you doing here?
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
What?
What are you doing here?
Which way?
How do you know?
We've lost SEN!
...it doesn't matter.
What was that....
Would you like part of this?
This one has eyes.
I knew him.
That's not it.
She's not there
Remember this...?
No...no you're wrong.
I'm sorry.
Just look at all those people.
Yes.
Yes
Yes.
....with me?
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.
May I help you?
Hey, that's the guy-
How's the print coming?
Coffee, Mike?
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Who the heck're you?
Where did you get this?
High-grade det cord.
Sorry about that.
Alright, let's check it out.
What're you talking about?
What was-? Why...?
What?
By the way, I'm Glass.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
I.
Nice performance back there.
The place has already be combed.
So what were they doing here?
This is where the van was parked.
Nitro-cellulose.
How long are we going to stay?
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
You guys seem pretty tight.

Who are you calling, sis?
Alex, please-
Drop it.
I want to work this.

You touch me again and--
You were lucky today, vice boy.
Prints?
It's a bluff.
What the hell's going on?
I'm filing charges against that mother-
He is!

How're you guys doing?
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.

Yes, sir.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Reilly, what's happening?
What?
Pardon me, m'sieu.
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
still studying the vase.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
No!
Eleven o'clock! 
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
What did you talk about?
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
Good morning, Major.
Nice day, Major.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
He's really not a bad fellow.
Yes, sir?
It must be the most marvelous supper.
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
I hope you find the figures correct.
Yes, m'sieu.
No, no, no!
Who?
Don't stop.
That's hotel life.
I like you, Baron.
Thank you, Baron.
Darling!
I always liked him.
You!
Filiba ...
yse seven, eight, nine, two.
Are you insane?
And you--
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
Yes...?
You know the main staircase in the opera?
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
Do you know my first name?
Eighteenth century.
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding.
Madame.
Yes, madame?
Crimson!
I want you to stay, Mariette.
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Thirty-three--
Yes, Gaston?
You look beautiful.
Why not?
Goodbye...
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Two lumps, madame?
Yes, madame?
Now.
Yes, madame?
I think you'd better go.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
Your bag?
How much time?
Your ship is a wonder, Mr.
I saw the iceberg, Mr.
Mr. Andrews, thank God!
Good luck to you, Rose.
I'm in the sitting room.
Who's the best? Say it.
Shit.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right?
So let me get this right.
Holy shit.
Hey, Lizzy.
What?
The partners want to know how it's going?
There's a satellite call for you.
This is Brock Lovett.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
None of the stewards have seen her.
She's not on the starboard side either.
I make my own luck.
We're too late.
What could possible be funny?
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
You told me to change.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
My God... Cal. Is it a --
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth.
Something serious has happened.
But I was with him the whole time.
Oh, Mother shut up!
Where are you going?
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
Is this in any way unclear?
You're precious to me, Rose.
I know.
This should be amusing.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
You're a good liar.
Let's see.
'Cause you're goin' to America!
You know somebody?
How you two doin'?
The boats are all going.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
I don't understand a one of you.
Why have we stopped?
Take my hand.
You're distracting me. Go away.
The fall alone would kill you.
How cold?
Ever been to Wisconsin?
I'm Jack Dawson.
HELP! HELP!!
Hello again.
So, you got a name by the way?
Mr. Dawson, I --
What's this?
Jack, these are quite good!
Oh no!
And these were drawn from life?
You liked this woman.
And...?
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Jack, must you go?
May I cut in, miss?
I don't know the steps.
You're not one of them.
You're making this very hard.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Will this light do?
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
What is it? A sapphire?
I believe you are blushing, Mr.
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
Where to, Miss?
Are you nervous?
You're trembling.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
It's bad.
This is horseshit.
Don't you believe it, Rose.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
You have to go for help.
Will this work?
I'm not going without you.
You jump, I jump, right?
Look for something floating.
It's getting quiet.
No.
April 14, 1912.
Wait!
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
I'm sorry.
Is your stateroom alright?
There, that's nice.
It's been 84 years...
I can still feel its weight.
Rose, tell us more about the diamond.
Don't come any closer.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Rose, this is not a game!
I don't understand you.
Rose, get in the boat!
Anya!
Anya, I think you're crazy.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Here's to Europe!
But, Anya, dear!
Hope we're not intruding.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
I can think of nothing nicer.
Feeling a little better, I see.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
Good afternoon--
I hope so.
Will you please excuse me?
Isn't she lovely?
No--I'm furious!
How do you do.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you?
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am!
You'll excuse me. 
Will you pardon me?
Did you find it?
Where'd you get it?
Hmm!
Aces full.
You're coming back--
How about a little game later?
Could I see you a minute?
No gentleman would do that.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
I'm so sorry!
I thought you were one of my friends.
Like her paint job?
Where have you been hiding?
This is great.
This is Mr.--er--
Isn't she attractive?
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
A little.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
What are you thinking?
Don't kid me.
What, again?
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
I could see you were pining away--
How well do you know her?
Well, I'll be--!!!
Not here--follow me around the shed.
Nix, the law!
Quick, let me have that money.
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
You don't think--?
Yer lucky I'm here at all.
Oh, Shortie!
This is a business trip!
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Inspector McKinney.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
About sixteen hundred.
You keep it-- 
Say--wait a minute!
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Come in! 
It's your deal.
How's your mother feeling?
I thought you were a sucker--
That goes two ways.
I'm going to the show--
Care to join us?
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
How about you?
Hello, young fellow!
Wouldn't bet against her.
Don't get yourself all worked up--
Mmmmmmmmmhm.
Here's your fifty.
That's too bad.
That's all right.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
Here you are, sir. 
Where do you live?
That's me!
Hello, Denby!
Come on, get up.
Oh, there you are--
McKinney's the name.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
I didn't--
Am I a member of this club?
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
Women are such fools!
You're just a Master of Ceremonies.
Yes.
Why--don't you like him?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
With your dry wit and humor--
Is that one of the Who's Who?
What happened to you?
That's him! That's the sucker!!
Can you read 'em Jack?
How much did you lose?
All right--but what is there to face?
Not because of Ned.
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
I know he is.
Yes, Yes!
It's getting kind of chilly on deck.
Congratulations.
That's the truth--every single word!
There you are, sir.
He's certainly good-natured.
I'm all right.
Everything in order, sir?
Nothin'.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
God damn son of a...
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.
Oh, my God...
Newcomers, eh?
So how's Tombstone treating you?
What d'you think of the singer?
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
I saw that look on your face just now.
Listen, I want to talk to you.
Easy.
He said to turn loose of him.
Where'd you get that horse?
Shut up, Ike.
I want them spitting blood!
Hey, you smell that?
I'm retired.
Come on, you...
Feel bad about ol' Fred.
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
I want you to know it's over.
Look at that!
Let me, let me, yeah!
Forget it.
That's the rumor.
Age quod agis.
That's just my game.
On three?  You call it.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
Here, Doc.
I calculate that's the end of This town.
You don't even know him.
That's my lovin' man.
What's wrong, Doc?
How you feeling, Doc?
We must talk, darling.
Doc!  How the hell are you?
Since when is faro a business?
Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.
Very cosmopolitan.
Very instructive
So now we're in the mining Business.
So tell me, Wyatt.
Satisfied?
He's drunk.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
Wyatt!
Wyatt, my God!
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.
Doc...
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc?
I'm sorry.
Well hell, Wyatt.
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"?
Drunks.
Don't touch me!
You really look awful.
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
All right, I'm on fire!
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
Are you out of your mind?
No.
See how she breezed out of here.
All right, what's it to be?
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.
Praise Jesus!
We're the law, ain't we?
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
What is it?
That was lovely!
See?
What's wrong?
You know this is adultery.
And I don't even know your full name.
Sorry about your friend.
I have to go.
Wyatt!  My God...
I have nothing left.
What can I get you?
You see that bird at the faro Table?
Come up to the fire, honey.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
That the bottle Lou gave you?
Mattie.  What about this?
All right, look.
Well hello, Sherm.
Run for your lives, boys!
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
No, wait.
Florentino!  He's getting away!
I know that cut.
What'd you do that for?
Next waterhole's Black Draw.
There they are.  No herd though.
I don't like it.
Well how do we look?
Give him some good exercise?
Boy, look at all those stars.
Really?
It's that woman from the coach!
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
Listen to me, both of you.
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours.
How you doin', boy?
You were right.
Dropped him, that was it.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
Get down, boy.
I just got it fixed.
You were right, Wyatt.
Go ahead.
Easy, gents.
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants.
Talked it over.
We should get moving.
Allie-girl...And Louisa!
Look at that.
Well that's your problem.
Look pretty rough.
Well we're off and running.
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
Keep your eye on that brass ring.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.
Maybe I jumped the gun.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Wait till the liquor wears off.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
Virgil?
What about all these saloons?
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
Why don't you just leave it alone?
... What were you saying, Admiral?
But -
It's too late -
Good evening.
Why wasn't the ship protected?
At least we know where the gold is.
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot.
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
How did you get this number?
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
Still, I do miss her.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
Welcome to the new world order, Mr.
You see, Mr.
Briefly.
...And what's that, my dear?
I'm sure they will.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
I'd rather die alone.
I'm sure she is, James.
4:30.
Moneypenny!
What - no lust for adventure?
Q! How are you?
Your new car. 
Yes -
Wait a minute -
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Oh, James. I've missed you -
Don't you even miss me?
What about Elliot Harmsway?
Do you feel better now?
What about the uranium?
I'm so sorry, James.
Paris -
Just - say it. Say it just once.
His newspapers?
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
Okay, Saunders.
It must do something.
Now pay attention, 007.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
... Shoelaces?
It was an authorized test.
A wedding band?
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Natalya?
I have to get these to London.
Yo!
I dunno, Jimbo.
I got you covered.
Sidney Winch, meet -
Where to now, Jimbo?
Interesting presentation.
... Does this do anything?
Married?
Here.
Bourbon. Neat.
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.
Boyfriend?
Actually, I'm here on business.
- Shut up!
Do I have to do everything around here?
I hope you'll be gentle.
And what do you call this?
If I were you -
Why don't we just take these -
... Do you have a gun?
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold.
This has got to be a mistake.
Wait here.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Not a lot of difference.
What the hell does that do?
Down?
What now?
Put your back to the railing.
Sometimes you just have to -
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
Sleep well?
... Yes???
Thank you Colonel Everhart.
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper.
... What's Harmsway done?
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
Sorry I'm late -
The infrared satellite images.
... And what do you call these?
And what do you call these?
Sakwa!
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Who's in charge here?
What's your name?
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
You won't get away with this!
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Damn. It's doing it again.
The back-up does the same thing.
How is it now?
A dead head.
What is HE doing here?
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
He brought that up from the wreck.
...Well!
How sweet.
That was too close.
Please, Sidney.
Bore through.
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Is the helicopter ready?
It's a trick!
They're on the bridge.
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.
What the hell is going on?
Please sir. Please -
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
What about ID's?
Oh, no.
Who is that?
Will it go off?
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
What time is it?
I pay my own way.
When are you boys going to fix that roof?
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
I'll drive her to the hospital.
I'm cold.
Why don't you come in for a while?
Why does he always pick on me?
You okay?
Who is it?
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
Did you ever have to use this thing?
What is that?
Never play with someone's else's cards.
I could swear I heard my son call me.
My mind plays tricks on me.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
Your feet are cold.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
Do you want your coat?
I'm worn out.
It's good to be able to hear that.
What, are you having another party?
Since this morning.
What did you put on it?
He's going to check out heaven first.
This is my grandson, Sunny.
Man, act like this is your home.
Good morning.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
What could have caused this?
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Good evening.
One can tell you are from back home.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Harry, you know everything.
What's the problem here?
How is everybody?
Can you watch Gideon for a while?
That smells like fresh coffee.
How is he doing?
Good afternoon, ladies.
There is something that I always wanted to know.
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot.
How many people do you all feed?
Harry, that's not nice.
None of your business.
Is this your house?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
I appreciate you lending me a hand.
Not you mustn't touch.
Did you have your child at home?
He just leeches off your parents.
What are you doing?
How are you?
Wow!  Cool!
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Come on down, guys.
To infinity and beyond!
Can I bring some toys?
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
I couldn't find my Buzz.
Can I help pump the gas?
Yeah?!
Next stop...
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Hey!  Wow!
Which one can I open first?
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
Uh, let what?
What are you doing over there?
We're almost there.
Whoooooah!
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Hello-o-o...
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Toy?
He's not a Space Ranger!
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Why, thank you.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.
And another thing.
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?
What's going on?
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
THAT is Sid!
I could have stopped him.
Buzz!
Right?  Buddy?
According to my nava-computer, the --
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
Wait a minute!
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Spaceship.
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
It's not working.
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Woody, stop it!!
What happened to you?
I think you've had enough tea for today.
Oh, I'm a sham!!
But -- the hat looked good.
Come on, this way!
Oh, come on, Buzz.
Buzz!
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Shhhhhhh!
Nice work, fellahs.
Hold on, Woody!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Great!
Woody?!  What are you doing?
Ha-ha!!
Ahhh!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
Me?
No, no!
It's not a laser!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hi!
Something's screwy here.
Oh, boy.
Hey, watch it!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
B-3.
No, no, not the ear.
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
Oh, that is disgusting.
What?
Hey!!
Sid, give her back!
MOM!!  MOM!!
Oh, no!
Where's my ear?
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
That ain't no happy child.
Huh?
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
A lunchbox?!
Laser-envy.
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
Who is it this time?
Wait a minute.
Good going, Slink!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?
Wait just a minute.
No!  No, no, no, no!
No!
No wait!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
C'mon, guys!
Shouldn't they be there by now?
Ha ha.
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
They're getting bigger.
What the heck is up there?
It's Sid!
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
I got it, Woody!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Sargent.
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Mission accomplished.
There.
Buzz.
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
This is ludicrous.
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
Reach for the sky!!
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
W-w-w-we?
Hey, Slinky?
I'm red this time.
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
Woody?!
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
Woody!  Speed up!
I can't hold on much longer!
You'll put your clothes here.
I can manage.
He's a pyjama case, really.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
He can't abide a woman in trousers.
Is there anything else I should know about him?
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
Mummy was scared of him, I think.
He made that. In his off hours.
Don't fret.
I want to go home.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
That's your beach.
Who's there?
You <i>are</i> cold.
He'll murder you when he finds out.
The swan was so ridiculous.
Stop it!
Reprieve.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
How long has -
I already lost everything once.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
They're going to fly everywhere.
I'm Melanie.
Did you do this?
You're well built; how old are you?
Oh no you can't.
I appreciate you coming in so early.
I... I don't really know.
Anna.
What?  What is it?
Why does he need money?
What is he planning on telling them?
Helena, I'm so sorry --
I understand.
Good.
Got it?
This place is swept twice a day.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you.
That was a stupid thing you did.
Helena, please.
Helena --
Did you get it?
It's the same stuff?
It's Saturday, Arnie.
Don't bother.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
I think she's lying.
How long have you known?
Should we bring the police into this?
About the other night, I'm sorry.
My Leica's gone.
Where are you going?
Did you meet the President?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Did you tell Dad?
He didn't hang around us.
Hi.
You all right?
How's David?
We'll get through this, I promise.
What's it like?
What if every country legalized at the same time?
Where is it?
Okay, young lady, that's it.
What is wrong with you?
...How old are you?
Private?
What are you doing?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
Ach, that's what I'm talking about.
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
No telltales.
Chill out --
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
That's a big word for a fisherman.
They're whispering.
You should see little Montel play.
Are you getting this on tape?
What do we do?
What do you think she wants?
What do you think it is?
I'll put this in the back.
David --
Women's room, stall two.
Yes.
They're going to walk right past me.
So, it's worth the wait, right?
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?
One chance here, Eduardo.
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
You first.
That's good coke.
Take this back with you.
You will help me with my other problem.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
Relax.
Please.
This is fucking crazy.
A group of us are going out tonight.
It's no problem.
Madrigal's alive.
Javi!
Somewhere safe.
It's important that we work together.
You should feel good about this.
What's your name?
One question.  How did you find about this?
That's your past.
Does this offer include my partner?
You watch and learn.
My work keeps me young.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline.
Who the fuck do you think you are?
She's not at that place you sent her?
Can you tell me anything?
Hey man, I'm sorry.
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
I just want to be clear about one thing.
Hello.
Salazar's been taken down.
Who are these guys?
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
Who do we interface with on their side?
What do we do?
Did you tell him?
What?
OK. Same again?
I'll be right after you.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
Twenty thousand.
For fuck's sake.
And remember, Rents: no skag.
It's a scandal, Franco.
What?
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Yes, you fucking do.
This was his nightmare.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Diane.
I don't see why not.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
What do you want?
You're not getting any younger, Mark.
It's so simple.
So, what's he like?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'?
Thank you, Mr.
Morning, Spud.
Are you getting out much?
You take the test?
Thanks, Mark.
Good luck, Spud.
You Only Live Twice?
Who wrote it?
Do you see the beast?
Oh, fuck.
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
Fuck you.
I can't believe you did that.
Why?
What?
What was your price?
What's on the menu this evening?
No, thank you.
Great.
This had better be good.
There.
It's the great outdoors.
How's it going with Gail?
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me.
We go for a walk.
Well, what are you waiting for?
What do you see as your main strengths?
Qual se tu?
He has his doubts...
Why?
No, no, it's not possible.
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
Bad news, gentlemen.
Don't tell them you're lost.
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Admit it. We're lost.
Um.
Sulu, what are you doing?
Following new course. Warp seven.
In firing position. Torpedo armed.
Shuttle en route.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
This is the Starship Enterprise.
You are a master of understatement.
What's going on?
Can we have it quiet?
You caught me on my way to the shower.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls.
Your pain runs deep.
Where did you get this power?
Don't you worry, Captain.
Scotty here, Captain.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
Mr.
She's got partial power, sir.
Mr.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
On the contrary.
Concentration is vital.
Oh, God
Oh, no.
What are you doing?
Oh.
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Come on, Spock.
Captain?
Goodnight, Spock.
I could use a shower.
Not General Korrd.
What is it?
Spock, what is it?
I do not often think of the past.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant.
Their equipment is primitive but effective.
Spock.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
You must allow us to act.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
You stay out of this!
You mean he's your brother brother?
Exactly.
Is it possible?
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
You're right.
New word.
I believe I have found a faster way.
It would appear we are too heavy.
Spock... the booster rockets.
Spock.
...mark two.
Spock... don't.
What is this?
Spock?
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones.
I must have your starship.
Who are you?
No! No reply. Remain on course.
What are you doing?
We must change our course at once.
I trust your message was received?
Sha Ka Ree.
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
No... I didn't.
Wait!
About the ship...
What have I done?
Borgus Frat.
They can't be serious.
Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty.
No, no, no.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
Sybok, you must surrender.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.
Each man's pain is unique.
Spock?
Sybok.
You did break in.
Dillinger?
Not if my Tron program was running.
Hi, Alan.
My dinner.
Flynn!
Your old files -- ?
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
How's it going upstairs?
Did you say Group 7 access?
What for?
For what?
Flynn!
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Beautiful!
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing.
Come on in...
What do you mean, "'yes"?
That all you can say?
I'm your program?
Way to go! We're haulin'!
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
This town's full o' live ones.
You said it.
Yes!
No problem, Master-C.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
Oh, I know all that.
That was uncalled-for.
Yes?
Well I want to communicate --
Who is your User, program?
Dumont!
Alan!
What, just the three of us?
What's that?
How about over there...that empty memory?
Flynn!!
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
No big deal.
We're on our way.
What about our friend - Sark?
Did we make it?
Hey... you guys OK?
A User -- in our world?
There's another beam!
How did you do that, Flynn?
Flynn, we've got to help him!
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Flynn... you can't... I
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Watch it!
Feel what? You okay?
What's goin' on?
Damn!
Hey... !
Hey!
So...how's the world of serious science?
Don't even say that.
Thank. you, Master Control.
Yes, MCP.
A User?
Wait...I need that...
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
New guy...
What do you think?
You think we can make it there?
Do you know what he's talking about?
Yori... hey...
My quarters.
You've grown, big program.
What is it?
Nice...
You bitch.
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
Can you cover me for an hour?
Where are you going?
That's not true, honey--
Dinner's in the warmer.
I'm done.
Dana, Mr.
Dana, are you listening to me?
How was school today?
There are going to be some changes Dana.

Son of a bitch!
Kids.
Uh huh.
Okay.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
You better watch it.
It doesn't mean anything.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
What?
Station wagon?
Helen's going to be pissed.
What's the plan?
There's another guy, still in the car.
Copy that.
Look at the way the little punk is driving.
So, you wanna play huh?
Ha!
Abu Kaleem Malik.
He-- Helen.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Guy's a spook!
Give me the page.
She's still at my house.						*
Goddamnit, Harry.
She's lying.
She could be telling the truth.
Now what?
We're dead, right?
You've reached a new low with this one.
I thought this look like your work.
Any minute now.
He's got it.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
My husband is a good man.
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
Do you like my tomb?
I've always been a collector at heart.
Yes.
Hello, Harry.
This is Samir.
You think I care about their					* cause?
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
I'm late.
How'd it go at the trade show?
That's fabulous Harry.
Uh huh.  Okay.
I need you to talk to Dana.
Hi honey.  What's going on?					*
Look, I know you're upset.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
What did happen?
Why did you continue to see him?
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
That's none of your goddamn business!
Let me handle this part.
I don't know.
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
What?
Oh, gee thanks.
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
Allison is sick in bed.
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
He's got nothing to do with this.
What were you doing there?
Harry, what's the matter with you?
I'm sorry, honey.
What did he give you?
17 years.
What is it?
What are you going to do?
Oh shit.
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
What're we talking about here?
Okay, just ask yourself.
You working on someone right now?
What does she do?
See.
Yeeaoowww!!
Beat it.
I said SIT DOWN.

Boris and Doris?
Who's your little friend?
Look, Harry's not part of this.
What's going on, Harry?
Like one?
Hello?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Where were you?
Did you read the papers yesterday?
That was you?!
Tell me what happened?
Were they trying to kill you?					*
What is it you want me to do?
What's happened?
To our assignment.
You see what I mean?
Thank you.
It's a good thing you pay me well.
What do you want me to do?
Who is this woman?

The letter I sent.
Has he looked through it yet?
Tell him to look through it.

Bye-bye.
Oh, look what happened.

Great movie. Action-packed!
Where's your car?
Well, enough about the King.
Ask me them again. One by one.

I'm not sure yet.
Wow. What a swell place to work.
Four hundred bucks.
What's that?
God, Spiderman looks different.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
You know when you sat behind me?
I love Janis.

You're a whore?

Clarence?
Well, there's a story behind all that.
What?
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Clarence sent a letter?
Money problems?
That's a pretty amazing story.

You're really in love, aren't you?
This shit can't be real.
It's fuckin' real!
This is Drexl's coke?
But you're an actor.
Clarence...
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
They didn't even want a callback.
Clarence.
What the fuck did you bring that for.
Do you really mean it?
No. But thanks.
I'd fuck Elvis.
Leave the gorillas.
I grow it on my window-sill.
What?
He wants to talk ya.
Where's everybody else?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Elliot.
Don't you?
Say it, goddamn it!
Yeah, I subscribe.
Well, then, what's the hurry?
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Now, that's practically uncut.
Where'd you go?
Wanna count your money?
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
I'm really not very -
What do you want from me?
They have nothing.
Thanks a lot, Daddy.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
I've seen him.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Oh, don't bother.
Come again?
That was very good.
Where'd he come from?
That Vietnam movie?
He'll wear a wire?
Krinkle, this is it.
Nicholson and I.
Suspect's words -
Like gang-busters.
You do more than try.
He knows.
We gotta get him outta there.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot.
Don't blow it, Elliot.
What was I sayin'?

Naw man, that's some serious shit.
Preach on, Big D.
Yeah, that's right, laugh.
Well fuck you guys then!
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
Fuck!
You gotta hold this for me.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Yes.
Excuse me, Mr.
What was the Jew-boy's name?
We want you to tell us about last night.
Wake up, Cole.
No, sir!
Well?
Him?  You saw that man?
Women will want to get to know you...
I understand.  There'd be no point.
To be determined by the proper authorities.
We want tough minded people.
He's drugged out of his mind!
We're very close!  Because of you!
That's him.
It's important to observe everything.
They forced me to take drugs.
Mr. Cole?
It was some lady.
James, where did you grow up?
It's just a shot to calm you.
Cole!
You used to call me "James".
"Never cry wolf!"
You were in my dream just now.
No, I think it was always you.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
Does that disturb you, James?
Look, I'm warning you.
They're keeping an eye on me.
Are you hurt?
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
I told you what I want.
Mason???
All I see are dead people.
The guy was a total fruitcake.
We need gas.
You smell so good.
What have you done?
What made you think that?
I need help all right.
James!
I don't understand what we're doing.
What does this mean to you?
I want to be here.
You want me to rob him?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
You... you couldn't have heard me.
I think I've seen this movie before.
Why are we doing this?
But maybe I'm wrong.
You were in my dream just now.
That's what they were up to!
I know this place!
They may be looking for us, James.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
What'd they give you?
Germs?!
"What about the germs?
They hurt you!
What're you writing?  You a reporter?
What....???
Never saw him before in my life.
Excuse me -- what did you say?
County Hospital, right?
I don't have time to go upstairs.
JOSE!
Jo...Jose????
Me?
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
Uh, that message...me?
But you know what's real now?
He was fully sedated!
He kidnapped you, Kathryn.
What...virus?
One dozen bolt cutters!
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?
You have him in restraints.
That would explain the bruises, I guess.
Nine thirty
Hey!  You there!
Get me a Dr. Peppa!
Don't forget to open it for me.
Oh, Jesus.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
The day wasn't so bad.
Any parting words of wisdom?
I'll take a piece of that bet.
It's a Movado.
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
It's nonsense.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Can I help you, sir?
We have a bus to Mexico.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Please, you don't understand.
You want somethin'?
Will he be back soon?
You want to take a look at my car?
That'll make five in a row.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Hey!
Accident.
Hey.
Hey there.
No!
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
What you want?
What the hell .
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.
Shasta!
What was that all about?
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
Lord!
Let me get your change.
Ned!
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
I could do that.
Is that the way you want it, boy?
. .
There you go, Mrs.
That wasn't so bad.
Jake.
Who was that on the phone?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
They look nice.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
What's the matter?
Jake, what is that?
Oh my God, Jake, no.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Jesus.
No, I've got it.
It's very nice of you to help me.
Wasn't nothing.
It's nothing.  Really.
Thank you, John.
Where you coming from?
That's good.
Nice place you got here.
My face tell you all that?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
You can let go of me now.
No more drapes to hang.
All right, Grace.  No more games.
You never did answer my question.
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
Doesn't the heat bother you?
All this nothing?
How far is it to California?
John?  John where are you going?
Shit!
Grace . . . Grace?
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
Where's the safe?
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
It's got to be here.
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.
If you want.
Let's go in the bedroom.
Let's do it here.
You got a suitcase?
John!
John . . .?
Sheriff Potter, please.
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
That's all talk.
I shot him.
You're crazy, you know that!
Jesus, Grace.
Well, nothing.
John!
Are you all right?
I can't make it.
John!
John, throw me the keys.
Who the hell are you?
I have half a mind to--
What happened to your hand?
Hey!
She does at that.
Would you?
Why would I kill her?
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
Nice office you've got.
Now what can I do for you?
Let's say I do want her dead.
I went to your place.
Yeah, well, me too.
I'm curious about something.
I asked you a question.
Honest, Toby.
I want to stay.
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
What happened to your hand?
You like Patsy Cline?
Hey, Mister.
You're too late, Toby.
Don't be afraid of him none.
I wasn't doing anything.
You're fucked.
Mister!
That's right, Mister.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.
Get up, Mister!
Now, what's this?
Nooo!
John, what a surprise.
That's a shame, John.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Fucking kid.
Kids.
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.
Nice night for a drive.
You bitch!
That's what this is all about?
What'd you think, boy?
Nobody's going to hang.
Got any cold soda?
I call the policia.
No police.
Hey!  You there!
Don't forget to open it for me.
Oh, Jesus.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Maybe I do.
Cocksucker motherfucker!
Ain't over yet.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
I wasn't doing anything.
Then maybe you should've.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Mister!
That's right, Mister.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.
Now, what's this?
Who the hell is this!?
What the fuck do you want?
California...
Hey!
She does at that.
"You can't shoot 'em!
Would you?
What can I do for you, lad?
How much could you get?
...I don't know.
Next time you'll do just fine.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
I came for Grace.
Shhh! Liar.
Come on, Jake --
Hey, Mister.
What happened to your hand?
You like Patsy Cline?
Hey mister.
You're too late, Toby.
Don't be afraid of him none.
You Harlin?
Will he be back soon?
You want to take a look at my car?
So?
Twenty-after-ten.
Accident.
Hey.
What the hell happened to my car?
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.

Hey there.
No! Okay! Okay!
Look, Harlin.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
What you want?
What the hell .
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.
All I got's a hundred, Darrell.
Got any cold soda?
I call the sheriff.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Jesus.
No, I've got it.
It's very nice of you to help me.
Wasn't nothing.
Thank you, Bobby.
Where you coming from?
That's good.
Nice place.
My face tell you all that?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
You can let go of me now.
I like them.
No more drapes to hang.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.
You never did answer my question.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot.
Are there snakes out here?
All this nothing?
What's the matter?...Grace?
You mean the Shaman?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Please.
Where?
In <u>cash</u>?
It takes a key.
I can't kill, Grace.
I wanted to talk.
Are you sure?
Grace ... Grace?
The money's right here! Get the key!
Bobby?
I can't see it.
Hey!
Get real Bobby.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Why?
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
I think nothing happens.
Well, nothing.
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
Hope is a four-letter word.
Thank you.
Why's that?
And I love you too.
<u>Jake</u>...
Morning, officer.
Where ya goin'?
That's a shame, Bobby.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
What'd you say to me!
I need a ticket.
How about Ciudad Juarez?
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Keep your change.
You got a beer?
Shasta!
Let me get your change.
Son of a bitch!
Morning Grace.
Anybody hurt?
I don't want the fuckin' money!
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
Who was that on the phone?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
They look nice.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
What's the matter?
Jake, don't go out there.
Help me, Grace, help...
I axed you a question.
Honest, Toby.
I want to stay.
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
Where's the fire sweetheart?
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there?
What's that?
Get out of the car, spread them.
Yes?
Proceed.
Is that the entire message?
Wrap it up.
Once again please?
I'm listening.
Is Jeremy okay?
I don't know.
...I can't remember.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
When was the last time I wore pink?
I've come to a decision.
Megan?
I remember you.
He's just laying in bed.
Would you like to try going--
Oh.
He didn't do anything.
...I think rust.
I didn't know that.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
I'm not sure.
Why?
You've never been sick?
What's he talking about?
I assumed because of the train.
This city has had its share of disasters.
What's this about?
It's for last week's game.
What do you want?
Just give me a minute.
I thought he was carrying something.
Yes.
Listen.
I have to go now.
Quick.
Are you finished?
I am.
He's doing well today.
Yeah?
When?
He going pro in the draft.
I'm going to go in.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson?
You put too much.
No.
How much did you take off?
How much is it?
What do you do if something happens?
How many did you put on that time?
I'm sleeping in my room.
I know now.
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
That was me they were talking about.
I'll just shoot him once.
Don't be scared.
You like sports?
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
Not really.
Yeah, hello.
He doesn't look very threatening.
How are you feeling?
Where were you sitting on the train?
Twelve years.
Is this a religious thing?
No more sitting in this room.
...I got a present for you.
Well, go get it then.
She's gonna live.
A whippin'?
Where'd you get the money, huh?
Rain's coming.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
He's coming ain't he?
What'd he say?
He didn't say nothin', huh?
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill.
He tell you where them others is?
I thought... you was an angel.
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.
I thought I was gone.
Are you really going to kill them?
Free ones?
I didn't mean.
Hullo, Bob.
Books. He's my biographer.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Mmmm pistols.
Shut up, Alice.
Hit your finger, huh?
Yeah?
Uh, no.
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
It's only a b-b-b-book...
The... Duck of Death.
Them's the keys.
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
Ned's share?
Who killed him?
William Munny, yeah.
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you?
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh?
He said that, huh?
I ain't like that no more, Kid.
Well, we was.
Three ways, I figured.
You're goin' back with him?
Now hold on, boys, hold on.
Say, Bill.
Get some sleep, Kid.

You could have it. All of it.

Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
I was lucky in the order.
We ain't bad men no more, Bill.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Three ways?
He musta been movin' right along.
Got used to my bed.

You was right to change your mind, Kid.

Jesus.  You done this before?
His pistol must of jammed.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
Depends what he told you.
He's gonna die, ain't he?
Jack. What are you doing here?
There was ninety-one million -
Keyser Soze
Not dope.
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze.
Now remember, this is another kind of business.
Give me some credit.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
Come home, Dean.
That's enough, Edie.
I know who he is.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
Forget him.
Fuck you.
This is not right.
Yeah.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
It's bullshit.
You heard right.
He's alright.
Why don't you just calm down'
Keaton, we gotta go.
It's a logistical nightmare.
I know you.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
What are we gonna do?
Me too.
We've met once or twice.
How do you do?
What the hell do you want?
Get out.
Don't hurt me.
They - That's bullshit.
What fence? Who?
You have to come.
They - They don't know me.
You watch your mouth.
I was out of line.
How are they going to do it?
We'll make it.
What is it Keaton?
What is this?
What-are they speaking?
Keaton, I can't just -
How are you, Keaton?
Ready?
Let's say for example -
with what?
My employer requires your services.
You set up the line-up.
The answer is no.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
I am sorry, Mr.
What did you say?
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
We're on vacation.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
A little of both.
Get a grip. I didn't know.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
What do you mean I can't see him?
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
When does he post bail?
He won't go into the interrogation room.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
No, no, no, no, no.
His name was Arturo Marquez.
Sure.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
That was all Fenster and McManus.
I don't know about that.
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
So this lawyer...
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
I came clean.
I've got immunity now.
You're stalling, Verbal.
Then what?
I wanted to.
A man in a suit with a slim build.
Don't shine me, Verbal.
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW.
I don't understand what you're saying.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department.
But Keaton had.
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason.
No...
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
Edie...
I didn't know.
You're not safe on your own.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
I'11 take my chances then.
Mr. Abraham...
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
He was accused of jury tampering.
What are you doing here?
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
... he wants to testify ...?
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
No, actually, she was referred to me.
Anything special about the case?
Thank you.  When Debby...
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
Ed Concannon.
Objection, we've...
Objection!
I did.
Mr. Concannon...?
Objection!
No further questions.
Thank you, your Honor.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
They lied.
Please sit down.
What is this going to cost?
You said you're gonna call me up.
It's all right, Mickey.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
She getting good care over there?
Dr. Thompson...?
Dr.
I didn't do too well for you.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.
Dr. Gruber ...
I appreciate--a man as busy as--
I read the hospital report on your client.
Yes.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
Well, well, when can we meet again.
Thank you ...
I can subpoena you, you know.
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
That's it...?
What is it?
I need an extension for my case.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Sustained.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Nothing further, your Honor...
I object, your Honor...
Continental Casualty...
Mr. Galvin's...
Hello, I'm calling from...
D'you find an apartment?
Jimmy!
Would you like me to leave...?
I've got to work...
Why don't you get some rest?
Do you think it's my fault?
And it's over...?
Joe...  Joe...
You're pressuring yourself...
Is it over?
Thank you.
Dr. Gruber.
I.
Hi, Mickey ...
I have to talk to you.
Are you out of your mind...?
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
We've got her sister.
Jimmy?
Been a long time, huh...?
So what?
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
What happened, Joey...?
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
How are you holding up?
Okay.
Are you with me...are you awake...?
Uh...the admitting nurse...
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
...yeah...good...
...four years ago...
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing in New York...?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.
We got a mistrial, you know.
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?
It's not a good case.
He saw her at the Northern Care...
We just can't do it anymore.
What does it mean?
Hi.
Thank you.
Kathy Price...
Yes.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Another, Frank . . . ?
I want to buy you a drink.
Well, well, well.  Huh?
Dr. Towler...
Franky can't make it.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Interesting business.
Like all this.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
Would you like a drink now?
Not what you think.
I didn't mean to be that rough.
How can I see her, to know her?
You've done well, Scottie.
Something else.
He had no right to say that.
Hello.
Hello?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
No, please!
Just let me talk to you.
I've heard that one before, too.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
What do you want to know?
Listen, what is this?
Will you have dinner with me?
Thank you again. Good-night.
Will you, Judy?
I like that one.
Okay.
There's Ransohoff's.
But I like that one, Scottie.
Scottie, what are you doing?
You want me to dress like her?
I don't like it!
I wish you'd leave me alone.
You don't even want to touch me.
The color of your hair...
The trouble is, I'm gone now.
Well?
Where shall we go for dinner?
Mmmm.
Come here.
I'm suddenly hungry.
I've got it.
Scottie!
We're going awfully far.
Where are you going?
Scottie, why are we here?
No, I don't want to go.
I'm scared.
And I couldn't follow her.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
Scottie, please...!
Did he train you?
I made it.
Oh, Judy!
What are you going to do?
Love me... keep me safe...
Why am I here? What happened?
You don't remember.
...Old Port Point!
Please drink your coffee.
The Palace of the Legion of honor.
Lucky for me you were wandering about.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
One shouldn't live alone.
Will you tell me something?
No, never before.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
-- talking to you...
Would you like some coffee?
I hope we will, too.
Good-bye.
I don't know.
Do you know where you're going?
How old?
What are you thinking?
Do you hear anything?
Would you like a drink of water?
Where are you now?
Where were you born?
No!... No!
No, I can't tell you!
Take me away from here?
I'm responsible for you now, you know.
There is so little I know.
I'm not mad.
Don't leave me... stay with me...
No, don't go away!
Where's your husband?
Go on.
You've been there before.
Go on with your dream.
Here with you.
My love... because I love you.
It's not fair, it's too late.
You believe that I love you?
Let me go into the church alone.
Is there something I can do for you?
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Oh, but she hasn't been here today.
And there!
Her car is gone.
Ow!!
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
Well?... what'll you do?
From that music.
It's a brassiere.
How's your love life, Midge?
Here, I'll show you what I mean.
Now.
Step number two.
Easy, now.
Johnny!
Wait a minute!
The poor thing....
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
Here you are.
Is she pretty?
Midge!
I did.
Mm. Better.
What was this desperate urge to see me?
What have you been doing?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time!
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
She died.
No, that's not it.
She'll be out in a moment.
Yes! That's it!
Oh, yes!
The stripper's here.
She's fucking hot!
Jesus.
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
Can't do what?
How ya doing?
We're leaving from my house in three hours.
It's really a stupid opinion.
You're an asshole Adam.
Tonight we return once again to the cave.
The floor was wet. She slipped!
Why?
This is pathetic.
Fucking Boyd.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Four hours and fifteen minutes.
Don't even start.
More.
She's got no fucking pulse.
Wait!
We have to call the ambulance.
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Are you sure this was an accident?
Stop it!
Stop it!
Bury her out in the desert.
Her blood is all over the bathroom.
Her fucking head was caved in.
Wrap her up in blankets.
Sun rises at 5:52.
Wait. Wait a minute.
How do you figure?
We have to get going.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
Fuck you Boyd!
What is your problem?
What?
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam.
I didn't do anything!
All right.
Don't snap at them!
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
Where's the candy?
We'll be ready Adam.
That's one idea.
Real times.
No.
The bucks gonna stop right here.
I tell mine that they're little men.
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
No way.
I want you to hear me out.
Have you thought about what I said?
My god.
Money?
Actually, no.
So. When is the wedding.
What are you talking about?
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
He's upset about Adam.
What is it?
What?
She's not here.
Okay. Hi.
Yup.
Is everything okay?
She's in there!
No I don't.
Your investment ideas never work out.
I don't think so Boyd.
But not tonight.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
Where do you look?
He's right.
I got her arm.
The past is the past.
What's your fucking point?
What's goosed?
He just had two.
He's too drunk.
You said that Boyd.
Tony?
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
No, I'm holding for Tony.
She's all your's Fish.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
Oh for Christsake Boyd.
Oh God. This is insane.
Nobody knows she's here.
All right people.
That is a load of shit.
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
Easy Boyd.
He's cracked up.
What's your point?
Regarding what?
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
Okay.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety.
That's right.
This is a situation that defies judgement.
Blood money.
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
Nope.
Your ideas never work out.
I don't hate women.
The Mexicans would love it.
A little gut check time fellas.
Oh that's just nothing.
This is going to stop right now.
The need to know is clear.
We're goosed.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Stop it!
Stop.
Okay Micheal, let's go.
May we have the rings please?
This is ridiculous.
Why is this Kid staring at me?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
Stop it. I'm sorry.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
That's absurd.
Do you love me?
We've got problems here.
Seating problems.
Will you please call the chair people?
Hello.
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Hello.
What's the word on the chairs?
This is our honeymoon.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Cancel?
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset.
It's okay.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
He kept saying he was protected.
Everything okay?
That's just insecurity.
Mike Brenn.
I'm not breathing right.
I don't care for him.
I'll take a ride.
I'm getting married...
Where did you get that?
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
I appreciate it.
That ought to be about the end of that.
No...No.
The first day.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
Where's Boyd?
You alright?
There.
Yeah?
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
We don't think so.
I love it.
Smart.
Good times.
She's dead.
Fucking desert.
Right.
Shut up Micheal.
You see for me it's over.
I'll come to you tonight.
Keep quiet.
Stop this, stop this.
Where's the camera?
So much the better.
No, miss.
They've got a real hen house here!
Don Amalio!
Which couch?
Take me there.
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
How long are you staying?
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
Come down here, you scamp.
What do you mean?
How did you know about that?
His mother wanted to keep him.
You must think I am a monster.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
I should like you to do something for me.
How strange you are!
You must think I'm mad.
Unfortunately ...
Leave us alone, Ramona.
You're lying.
Think about it.
Let me pass!
All that I said just now was a lie.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Sit down, woman, sit down.
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona?
The way she looked at me, Ramona!
You believe me, don't you?
Don't lie.
What will the lady say?
Is it all right?
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
How much is that?
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
Hold on, Ramon!
Me?
It won't take but a minute.
It's very good.
My God, what have you done to him!
Ramona! Ramona!
What's the matter with you?
She's mad.
So, Ramona!
If you wake first, wake me up.
Shouldn't I be?
What are you thinking about?
She isn't my cousin.
How in hell does it wind up?
You see how much you like her?
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
Me, rich? Come on!
I don't want you to untie me.
Kill him.
He was very good.
I don't know, sir.
And this chest?
I don't know; I can't remember.
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge.
What do you know about me?
What are you doing here? Get out.
Are they going to work here too?
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer.
Yes. Why?
And ...your friend?
It's for people!
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
How are you today?
Are your parents alive?
You'll soon find out, you liar!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
Why are you crying?
It's a very big one.
He came in through the cupboard.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
What's going on, Moncho?
In you go!
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
Mother?
I hardly know him.
But why does he want to see me?
Good morning.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
Give the little girl to me.
Don't talk like that!
She has the face of an angel.
What about you, Manuel?
She looks like a sick marrow!
Ask the priest, miss.
Welcome, miss.
How do you feel?
What happened to me?
Hello.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
What?
How did you see me?
I'm going to the hen house.
In English, please.
It was very wellhidden.
You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you.
Recognize this?
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
You all right?
You're wasting your time.
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
She saved your life, Parker.
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex.
I should have told him.
There is no way Parker killed those guards.
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
I watched your simulation, Mr.
Think you can do it?
What happens if I can't catch him?
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
This better not be a wild goose chase.
What did Cox pull him out early for?
What the hell happened?
How does he know who I am?
HEY!!!
Get that fucking thing away from me!
... and you get nanodeath.
You need a maid.
I wonder how that...
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
You catching my drift?
SID  NO!!!
I am beautiful, aren't I?
You actually listen to all those tapes?
I need to know what snapped in you.
I don't need a babysitter.
You all right?
You ready for this?
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
What are you doing?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
Give me your wrist.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
Don't get out of the car.
What the hell's going on?!
What did you do to those people?
What's the problem?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
Real effective security...
Which way?
Parker - stop!
Grimes is back!
We know you didn't kill those guards.
He didn't know about the neural toxin.
How did you find out about the toxin?
See something?
Nice work.
Find out anything?
Can I ask you something?
You okay?
Where the hell are you going?
How's your pulse?
What do we do now?
Where's John?
The symphony of collision...
You and me have nothing in common.
You...mother...fucker!
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
There you go  best seat in the house.
Aren't you going to watch with me?
Thank-you, Daryl.

Don't cross Gordon.
Are you mad!
You really mean that?
Hi.
How you doing Buddy?
Morning Buddy, you look happy.

Mr.

I thought this was an informal meeting.
So what's the problem Sunshine?
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?
He respond to the offer?
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
Cards are on the table.

But?
Anybody want another drink?
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
Oh Mark.

Hello?

I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Haven't we been doing our homework.
Getting scared?
Then why do you still like her?
No Mark. MARK Why not?
You aren't sick!
Well?
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Sarah listen to me.
Anyone else not coming?
This time I really don't see anyone man.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.
No thank you sir we're fine.
Well?
Can this be stopped?
Darling?
Stop saying things so loud!
You bet.
Do you have a scarf?
Yes?
That was very good.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
He loves you very much.  He just--
Are you mad at me?
I miss you.
Did you?
Who's idea was it?
I didn't want to come.
Why is he worried?
Fireball?
These are good.
What?
Are you humoring me?
How?
What's happening to me?
She said, "You know.
I felt.
What?
Of course.  You must be so proud.
How're you holding up?
I'm sorry?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
For the Dupont Chair.
Yes?
Well maybe your wife...
Who?
Who are you?
Hello?
What?  What are you afraid of?
Tell me.  Please.
Tell me.  I can help you.
Oh God.
I wanted to apologize.
Would you like some iced tea?
Your house is so beautiful.
No.
Love.
You must think I'm pathetic.
Mrs. Frank?
What's your name?
Just plain old coffee.
You look a little old for a student.
Why are you here?
Full scholarships.
They're calling me in to work.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
What was her major?
Wow.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
You should have heard her play.
She got it.  Turned it down.
How you holding up?
What is it?
Oh my god.  You bought it.
You think he killed her?
Know what I think?
Someone's there.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Sit down here.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Nothing's happening.
Oh...
Mef?  What's Mef?
I have to go.
Are you okay?
Does Norman know?
Okay.  Okay.
Oh God...you knew.
I got there first.
I'm a terrible friend.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
Alight, alright.
You've got a beautiful life.
What's their name?
She's awake.
When's she out of here?
Alright.
It's today?
Claire?
Whatcha reading?
Excellent.
If you have to work...
How are you?
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
You did a great job.
It's just us now.
Tired?
Did you...
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Maybe we should just...
Of what?
Honey, they're young.
I just wish you could have heard her.
Norman, you have to look at this!
Nothing.
Hi.
Oh.
Claire?
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
It was there.
I've got the conference next week.
Think I may have cracked it.
I think so.  Maybe.
Ohmigod.
Sorry.  You understand.
Get down!  He'll see.
He killed her.
Our house.
It's a flare.
Where is she then?
See?
When you do this, I swear...
What are you doing?
You're not at the center.
There we go.
I don't need a shrink.
Are you lonely?
What are you doing out here?
How do you know this?
What?
Keep your voice down.
Maybe you're right.
I'm sorry...
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.
Do I have everything?
What?
You know I am.
You don't remember?
You dropped a glass.
I may have seen her on campus.
I take it your not mad at me.
Ow!
I don't like this, this...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
"You know..."
I was there.
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
Claire, please don't...
THAT'S NOT TRUE!
Leave her out of this!
I tried to break it off!
She was damaged and unstable.
She did it.
We have to get out of here.
The leaves...
What's that for?
She's out there isn't she?
Mmmuh...
What?
:What, you're doing Darcy?
Many times over the past thirty years.
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
Lasher will act, Rowan.
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
There are two.
With his hands!
How do you know about Rowan ...?
I - r saw him as a child.

You're very clever, aren't you...?
I'm going to have a baby.
There is no one here but the dead.
A girl...?

I know that you're evil.
You mustn't hurt him.
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
What is wrong...?
No!
Aaron was in the dream.
The portraits, Lasher.
Oh god...
Rowan and I will be together now.

It's unbelievable that you can do that.
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
Too much... too fast...?

You look very deep when you do that.
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...?

Seems more like a year than a month.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Hello...?
You know...?
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Stop looking at me like that!
Do you love me, Michael...?
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
What about your work back home...?
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
You sure...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Ro, how long have we known each other.
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
Wanna snack...?
Hey - you're bleeding.
You look a little green.
Gee - look at that.
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
No - I didn't kill him.
You did that, didn't you...?
You alright...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.

Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
Something's wrong with you.
Hi.

Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.
Wow...
You okay...?

Rowan Mayfair.
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.
We'd better get to work on the papers.
Which do you think is her best shot...
OH MY GAWD!
I thought you were someone else
Sounds good - thank you
When could I look round?
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
This must be one of the old keys -
It doesn't mention 'females only'
I lost the touch
Do you take sugar?
What are you doing?
My names isn't ANGELA...
Sugar?
So what do you do?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
How long have you been watching me?
Tell me about your wife...
What didn't you like about her?
Tell me how it happened...
And how did it feel to be rid of him
My mother...?
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
What?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
What is it?
Yes...
Where are you going?
We've got nothing to talk about
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
First finish your tea...
Why did you let him in?
I don't like sugar
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
Well, what do you think?
What's wrong with you?
I want you out now
What happened?
It's been what, three years?
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
Just put it in my room
Her husband left her
I thought it was you - how are you?
That's good
Dr STECKLER?
Dead?
Sugar?
ANGEL...
Come on, bro.
I genuinely think she wants me.
See? Did you see that?
Someday, I'll find out.
Don't do it, Ted.
Who the hell was your father?
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
This is the life, baby.
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette?
I can't believe that's your mother.
This is like my every wet dream come true.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
So far away? In Xenia?
Check this out.  Hurry!
Hurry.
Don't tell me.
I get it now.
Don't be such a pansy.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
You're late, bro!
I thought I loved her.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
Get them together.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
You got everything you ever wanted.
Naked girls, wild sex, video games.
Never say never.
What gives, Don Corleone?
Not bad for a hack.
Teddy?
Ted, have you lost your mind?
You really don't get it, do you?
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
Hi, Teddy Bear.
Remember dress up day?
Well?
God, you are so hot.
We can't accept it.
Sweetheart, what is it?
You have to understand.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy.
We think you should give up the magazine.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy.
I remember spring break of my senior year.
You guys are my parents.
Son.
Ted, it's your dad.
Finally, some gratitude.
But those are our dreams, son.
Sorry I--
I paid off the mortgage!
THAT is your dream, not mine.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
I-I don't have the keys.
You do know how to drive?
Now release the brake.
The first time can be awkward.
I'm Ted, by the way.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Who exactly ARE you?
Teddy? I was thinking.
Ted! Do something!
Well?
Oh, sweetheart!
But we did want you.
Can you believe that was me?
You're on the next plane home.
No problem, consider it done.
I wondered about them, for so many years.
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy.
Mom, Dad.
James, what are you doing here?
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
If you could just sign right there.
That's it?
He was my Grandfather, too.
Great.
So, William Randolph.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
I tried to warn you, William Randolph.
What is it, William Randolph?
What do you want from me?
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Don't write that part.
Well? What do you think of her?
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Wow...you clean up nice.
Where are we going?
Cut to the chase, William Randolph.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade.
That's probably my office.
I don't know.
Look at us.
Do you trust me, Julie?
I want you to trust me.
I have to be honest with you, Ted.
Julie, wow.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating.
Planet Ted.
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
They're playing our song.
What is this?
That's part of growing up, honey.
What about Charlie?
I'm all right, Mom.
Well? Surprised?
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Don't you get it?
But who would run the store?
Everything I am is because of you.
I need your help.
I like you, Ted.
Honestly, Merk.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
You kicked us off your turf, Merk.
Smashing!
You do like girls, don't you?
Maybe she needs help, Ted.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
You ready for your big coming out party?
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
You're the Sultan of Semen.
I told you you could do it.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
So far, so good.
My father must've been amazing.
Such enthusiasm.
I owe it all to you.
Yes?
I loved my brother.
What are you doing?
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson.
In a hurry, are we?
Oh no.
My parents? What do you mean?
How quaint.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
Talk to me Artie.
How you doing, Artie?
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
You look pretty.
How soon can we get something?
Merritt, Forensics.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.
You okay?
How are you, Kelly?
Did you try to fight him?
Did you call anyone?
How long?
I don't know what to say...
Kelly's file.
I've got that two o'clock in town.
It's our job, Gloria.
Same as him.
You saw the news today?
So what about the girls?
Guess I kind of lost it there.
We all have...
It's starting, Gloria.
If you want company...
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Will you do me one favor?
Stick with me on this Gloria.
I'm tired, Ray.
That bothers you?
About a year ago.
He did say something.
Why?
That doesn't make him a child rapist.
I want a full-scale investigation.
Are you crazy, Ray?
Oh, Ray... no...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
I fucked up.
She bit you?
I told her I was coming with her.
The teeth, were they...
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
What did you do then?
Ms. Toller?
This wasn't my idea.
He was my friend at first.
Come on.
Thank you, Jimmy.
It's those rocks, up there.
I say something funny?
Will you calm down.
I can't believe you called Sam.
What are you looking at?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
I wanna live at the beach someday.
Is there some reason why you're here?
Excuse me?
Get off my property.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Okay, what's the matter?
Kelly.  What is it?
What?
He... Sam Lombardo?
Okay, try me on Sunday.
Don't forget the car wash.
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
So, where you off to now?
All right.
Kelly...
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
How much?
God, you scared the shit out of me.
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
I'm here.
I'm sorry, Kelly.
Hello?
I'm really serious.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
I'm running away.
But check this...
Good thinking.
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
You're not in bad shape, really.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
Come on, let loose!
Who is it?
Where is she?
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
It's Celine.
No.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.
Is that what you think?
Get away from me.
Davy.
You.
Sam, for godsake.
I had to go look for this coupon.
But she ran away.
Fuck you.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.
You mean this thing?
Jesus, man... You okay?
Sam...
But I..
Yeah, right.
I was worried about you, Suzie.
That was about as grim as it gets.
What?
What's wrong?
How...
What?
I can't, Sandy.
Sandy... What's up?
Look.
Grab a clue, Sam.
J. S. Bach.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.
But don't pull that again.
Eight scientists.
Sorry.
Attractive buttons, yes?
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Aha!
Limestone quarry?
Doyle, once around the park.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
That's a lot of butler.
Doctor V.
You feeling all right?
Now, what was that?
What was all that back there?
Garrison...?
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
At least I tried something.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
Jim, are you all right?
So... what happened?
You might have mentioned you had that.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
Can you fill me in here?
Know what this is?
This is good.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
No record of him.
What's this?
Willard...
Got to be somewhere that's hot.
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
What is that?
Not again.
When we find him, he is mine.
Excellent detective work, sir.
Artemus, you ready for this?
It was in your book.
Are those just button buttons or...?
My hat is off to you, sir.
God in heaven, what is that?!
My God!  He's so excessive!
Pull the balloon right in front of him!
The machine was stopped!
Artemus!
Terribly sorry.
You didn't tell us you had this on!
He calls it the Tarantula.
He's not giving up?
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
A new friend?
Anyone?
My name's Tyler.
Please do.
Oh, don't worry.
You must excuse the Doctor.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
You've... done... this... before.
She's perfectly safe.
My.  It's gotten longer.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Your private train, sir.
Doyle's the name, sir.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel.
Good work.  Really.
Goddamnit!
... well, of course you can.
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
Very good, sir!
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
Why don't we just cut this routine short?
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.
You're not that big.
Still alive.
You got that right.
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
I've even printed my own currency.
Easy now.
Dr. Pemberton?
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Are you all right?
This is something.
Now it's a bomb.
I beg your pardon?
Well?
Hey...!
We're going into battle, little one.
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
Airk!
You left me to die, friend.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan?
You're chasing a dream.
Thank you, friend.
Willow Ufgood.
No, Willow.
You are the guardian, Willow.
The way has been lost in time.
Why can't you do it?
They look like acorns.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
Now, you know where you're going?
Go in the direction the bird is flying.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
I can't.
I can't.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
I do what I'm told.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Why did you say that?
Because it's true.
Sorsha.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Then you get us out of here.
Who is that girl, anyway?
We're a tiny version of all that?
Bavmorda cannot transform you.
Please?
Don't make me angry, Peck.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
You a woodcutter?
You all right?
Smells like a battle.
What's that?  I hear something!
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
Nobody's gonna take your baby.
You gotta promise to feed her.
Here are her diaper rags.
You!!
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Time to change her diaper.
Because she's sick.
Where's the baby??
Madmartigan, I need your help.
I was in love once, Willow.
I'll help you...!
Did she ask about me?
She said lots of thing.s
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
She's in love.
You?
Madmartigan!
I have an idea.
I don't know, Willow.
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Dada, what's a daikini?
I could be you rguard!
Who are you!  Who are you!
What do you want!
Kill him!
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
You must learn magic.
Willow.
I hope she's all right.
I'm all finished.  Now what?
How am I gonna do that?
We don't have much time left!
Your will!
But what am I gonna transform??
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Ouch!!
What'd you bit me for!!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
I just wanted to test it first.
Tir Asleen.
How??
I did it!
Raziel!
Get down!
Time is running out.
Patience, Willow.
Elves!
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
I'm not going in there.
Are you sure?
We gotta follow them.
Get back here, Rool!
She needs to be changed.
She needs to be changed again.
She's hungry.
I'm getting her out of there!
Ohhh, I hate this.
This is not going well.
Talk!  Say something!
Hey, careful there!
We've traveled a long way.
Obviously.
This can't be right.
Sure, I'm sorry.
Didn't you hear me, Book?
Eat up, Book.
How could you do this to me tonight?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Good morning.
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Your hole is healed, then?
Nail it!
Everything is all right, John.
I saw him.
Who'd you see, Sam?
He was... like him.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Hey, Sam...
Is it them?
Don't let them hurt you.
Are you really ever coming back?
How reliable is this kid?
Last guy I would have figured.
What's your first move?
Who else knows?
You made a mistake, Paul.
It's all over, Paul.
I'm a police officer.
Where are you taking us?
What was that?
Now what's the problem?
Whacking?
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
But not a good tired.
Your sister said you don't have a family?
Oh? Anything else?
Why don't you arrest that man?
But why would they murder...
Where are you taking us now?
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
Stay for awhile.
Who are they?
Does anybody know I'm here?
Tell him his tea stinks.
Enjoying your reading?
Your husband's?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.
Where's the nearest telephone?
The... bullets?
Eli is a fine carpenter.
You know carpentry?
Sure.
When will you be going?
Won him over just like that.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.
Anybody know about this?
I got there late, John.
It's me.
You hear me?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
You know where he is.
You admit you're lying?
Did you find him?
Everything okay?
Good morning.
Just a minute.
What's so funny?
Who was that man?
Is the English dead?
That has no place in this house.
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus?
Eli, John is a carpenter.
How can this be?
I am not a child.
No, Rachel...
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
She say where he is?
What about Carter?
Weird, man.
He's not in this building.
No, you listen. Get out!
He'll live.
Get back in there.
Is this where we're going?
Momma... are they angry with us.
I don't want to stay here.
Aunt Em!
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Dorothy!
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles.
Uhh -- yeah --
From now on you'll be history
Our echo.
Oh, come on - come on!
...have you come back?
...resourceful!
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Uhhhh -- yes...
Yes-s-s -- that.
Frightened?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
...didn't you?
What are you going to do with my dog?
No!
Ahh!  Ah!
Run, Toto, run!
Toto's my dog.
I thought you said she was dead.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!
Oh, will you help me?
...Toto, too?
Are you ready now?
Yes, I'm ready now.
Yes --
That's our farm!
...her face is careworn.
That's right.  What's she doing?
...room --
...paper?
...bed.
Oh -- 
That dog's a menace to the community.
Now you're seeing reason.
Here!
Oil can.....Oil can....
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Oh --
Oh --
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh --
We might.
And bears!
And him a brain.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh, he's just ascared again.
No.  Why only --  Oh --
